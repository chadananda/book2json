    <h3>
      ACT I
    </h3>
    <p>
      <span class="stage-direction">[SCENE.--A room furnished comfortably and
      tastefully, but not extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads
      to the entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer's study. Between
      the doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door,
      and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs and
      a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another door;
      and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy chairs and
      a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small table. Engravings
      on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small objects; a small
      book-case with well-bound books. The floors are carpeted, and a fire burns
      in the stove.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="stage-direction">It is winter. A bell rings in the hall;
      shortly afterwards the door is heard to open. Enter NORA, humming a tune
      and in high spirits. She is in outdoor dress and carries a number of
      parcels; these she lays on the table to the right. She leaves the outer
      door open after her, and through it is seen a PORTER who is carrying a
      Christmas Tree and a basket, which he gives to the MAID who has opened the
      door.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Hide the Christmas Tree carefully,
      Helen. Be sure the children do not see it until this evening, when it is
      dressed. <span class="stage-direction">[To the PORTER, taking out her
      purse.]</span> How much?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Porter</span>. Sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. There is a shilling. No, keep the
      change. <span class="stage-direction">[The PORTER thanks her, and goes
      out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes off her
      hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one
      or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door and listens.]</span>
      Yes, he is in. <span class="stage-direction">[Still humming, she goes to
      the table on the right.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[calls
      out from his room]</span>. Is that my little lark twittering out there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[busy
      opening some of the parcels]</span>. Yes, it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Is it my little squirrel bustling
      about?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. When did my squirrel come home?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Just now. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and
      wipes her mouth.]</span> Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have
      bought.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Don't disturb me. <span
      class="stage-direction">[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
      the room, pen in hand.]</span> Bought, did you say? All these things? Has
      my little spendthrift been wasting money again?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes but, Torvald, this year we really
      can let ourselves go a little. This is the first Christmas that we have
      not needed to economise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Still, you know, we can't spend
      money recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit
      more reckless now, mayn't we? Just a tiny wee bit! You are going to have a
      big salary and earn lots and lots of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Yes, after the New Year; but then
      it will be a whole quarter before the salary is due.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Pooh! we can borrow until then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora! <span class="stage-direction">[Goes
      up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.]</span> The same little
      featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today, and you
      spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year's Eve a slate
      fell on my head and killed me, and--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span> <span class="stage-direction">[putting
      her hands over his mouth]</span>. Oh! don't say such horrid things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Still, suppose that happened,--what
      then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. If that were to happen, I don't
      suppose I should care whether I owed money or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Yes, but what about the people who
      had lent it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. They? Who would bother about them? I
      should not know who they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. That is like a woman! But
      seriously, Nora, you know what I think about that. No debt, no borrowing.
      There can be no freedom or beauty about a home life that depends on
      borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely on the straight road so far,
      and we will go on the same way for the short time longer that there need
      be any struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[moving
      towards the stove]</span>. As you please, Torvald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[following
      her]</span>. Come, come, my little skylark must not droop her wings. What
      is this! Is my little squirrel out of temper? <span class="stage-direction">[Taking
      out his purse.]</span> Nora, what do you think I have got here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[turning
      round quickly]</span>. Money!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. There you are. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Gives her some money.]</span> Do you think I
      don't know what a lot is wanted for housekeeping at Christmas-time?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[counting]</span>.
      Ten shillings--a pound--two pounds! Thank you, thank you, Torvald; that
      will keep me going for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Indeed it must.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, yes, it will. But come here and
      let me show you what I have bought. And all so cheap! Look, here is a new
      suit for Ivar, and a sword; and a horse and a trumpet for Bob; and a doll
      and dolly's bedstead for Emmy,--they are very plain, but anyway she will
      soon break them in pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs
      for the maids; old Anne ought really to have something better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And what is in this parcel?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[crying
      out]</span>. No, no! you mustn't see that until this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Very well. But now tell me, you
      extravagant little person, what would you like for yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. For myself? Oh, I am sure I don't
      want anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Yes, but you must. Tell me
      something reasonable that you would particularly like to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, I really can't think of
      anything--unless, Torvald--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[playing
      with his coat buttons, and without raising her eyes to his]</span>. If you
      really want to give me something, you might--you might--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Well, out with it!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[speaking
      quickly]</span>. You might give me money, Torvald. Only just as much as
      you can afford; and then one of these days I will buy something with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But, Nora--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Oh, do! dear Torvald; please, please
      do! Then I will wrap it up in beautiful gilt paper and hang it on the
      Christmas Tree. Wouldn't that be fun?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What are little people called that
      are always wasting money?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Spendthrifts--I know. Let us do as
      you suggest, Torvald, and then I shall have time to think what I am most
      in want of. That is a very sensible plan, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[smiling]</span>.
      Indeed it is--that is to say, if you were really to save out of the money
      I give you, and then really buy something for yourself. But if you spend
      it all on the housekeeping and any number of unnecessary things, then I
      merely have to pay up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Oh but, Torvald--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You can't deny it, my dear little
      Nora. <span class="stage-direction">[Puts his arm round her waist.]</span>
      It's a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a deal of money. One
      would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It's a shame to say that. I do really
      save all I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[laughing]</span>.
      That's very true,--all you can. But you can't save anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[smiling
      quietly and happily]</span>. You haven't any idea how many expenses we
      skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You are an odd little soul. Very
      like your father. You always find some new way of wheedling money out of
      me, and, as soon as you have got it, it seems to melt in your hands. You
      never know where it has gone. Still, one must take you as you are. It is
      in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things,
      Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Ah, I wish I had inherited many of
      papa's qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And I would not wish you to be
      anything but just what you are, my sweet little skylark. But, do you know,
      it strikes me that you are looking rather--what shall I say--rather uneasy
      today?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Do I?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You do, really. Look straight at
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[looks
      at him]</span>. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[wagging
      his finger at her]</span>. Hasn't Miss Sweet Tooth been breaking rules in
      town today?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No; what makes you think that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Hasn't she paid a visit to the
      confectioner's?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, I assure you, Torvald--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Not been nibbling sweets?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, certainly not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Not even taken a bite at a macaroon
      or two?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, Torvald, I assure you really--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. There, there, of course I was only
      joking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[going
      to the table on the right]</span>. I should not think of going against
      your wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. No, I am sure of that; besides, you
      gave me your word-- <span class="stage-direction">[Going up to her.]</span>
      Keep your little Christmas secrets to yourself, my darling. They will all
      be revealed tonight when the Christmas Tree is lit, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Did you remember to invite Doctor
      Rank?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. No. But there is no need; as a
      matter of course he will come to dinner with us. However, I will ask him
      when he comes in this morning. I have ordered some good wine. Nora, you
      can't think how I am looking forward to this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. So am I! And how the children will
      enjoy themselves, Torvald!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. It is splendid to feel that one has
      a perfectly safe appointment, and a big enough income. It's delightful to
      think of, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It's wonderful!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Do you remember last Christmas? For
      a full three weeks beforehand you shut yourself up every evening until
      long after midnight, making ornaments for the Christmas Tree, and all the
      other fine things that were to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest
      three weeks I ever spent!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I didn't find it dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[smiling]</span>.
      But there was precious little result, Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Oh, you shouldn't tease me about that
      again. How could I help the cat's going in and tearing everything to
      pieces?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Of course you couldn't, poor little
      girl. You had the best of intentions to please us all, and that's the main
      thing. But it is a good thing that our hard times are over.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, it is really wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. This time I needn't sit here and be
      dull all alone, and you needn't ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little
      hands--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[clapping
      her hands]</span>. No, Torvald, I needn't any longer, need I! It's
      wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! <span class="stage-direction">[Taking
      his arm.]</span> Now I will tell you how I have been thinking we ought to
      arrange things, Torvald. As soon as Christmas is over--<span
      class="stage-direction">[A bell rings in the hall.]</span> There's the
      bell. <span class="stage-direction">[She tidies the room a little.]</span>
      There's some one at the door. What a nuisance!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. If it is a caller, remember I am
      not at home.

    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Did he go straight into my room?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Maid</span>. Yes, sir.

      <span class="stage-direction">[HELMER goes into his room. The MAID ushers

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[in
      a dejected and timid voice]</span>. How do you do, Nora?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[doubtfully]</span>.
      How do you do--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. You don't recognise me, I
      suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, I don't know--yes, to be sure, I
      seem to--<span class="stage-direction">[Suddenly.]</span> Yes! Christine!
      Is it really you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, it is I.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Christine! To think of my not
      recognising you! And yet how could I--<span class="stage-direction">[In a
      gentle voice.]</span> How you have altered, Christine!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, I have indeed. In nine, ten
      long years--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Is it so long since we met? I suppose
      it is. The last eight years have been a happy time for me, I can tell you.
      And so now you have come into the town, and have taken this long journey
      in winter--that was plucky of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I arrived by steamer this
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. To have some fun at Christmas-time,
      of course. How delightful! We will have such fun together! But take off
      your things. You are not cold, I hope. <span class="stage-direction">[Helps
      her.]</span> Now we will sit down by the stove, and be cosy. No, take this
      armchair; I will sit here in the rocking-chair. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Takes her hands.]</span> Now you look like your
      old self again; it was only the first moment--You are a little paler,
      Christine, and perhaps a little thinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. And much, much older, Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Perhaps a little older; very, very
      little; certainly not much. <span class="stage-direction">[Stops suddenly
      and speaks seriously.]</span> What a thoughtless creature I am, chattering
      away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. What do you mean, Nora?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[gently]</span>.
      Poor Christine, you are a widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes; it is three years ago now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers.
      I assure you, Christine, I meant ever so often to write to you at the
      time, but I always put it off and something always prevented me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I quite understand, dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It was very bad of me, Christine.
      Poor thing, how you must have suffered. And he left you nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And no children?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Nothing at all, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Not even any sorrow or grief to
      live upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[looking
      incredulously at her]</span>. But, Christine, is that possible?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[smiles
      sadly and strokes her hair]</span>. It sometimes happens, Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. So you are quite alone. How
      dreadfully sad that must be. I have three lovely children. You can't see
      them just now, for they are out with their nurse. But now you must tell me
      all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No, no; I want to hear about
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, you must begin. I mustn't be
      selfish today; today I must only think of your affairs. But there is one
      thing I must tell you. Do you know we have just had a great piece of good
      luck?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No, what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Just fancy, my husband has been made
      manager of the Bank!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Your husband? What good luck!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, tremendous! A barrister's
      profession is such an uncertain thing, especially if he won't undertake
      unsavoury cases; and naturally Torvald has never been willing to do that,
      and I quite agree with him. You may imagine how pleased we are! He is to
      take up his work in the Bank at the New Year, and then he will have a big
      salary and lots of commissions. For the future we can live quite
      differently--we can do just as we like. I feel so relieved and so happy,
      Christine! It will be splendid to have heaps of money and not need to have
      any anxiety, won't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, anyhow I think it would be
      delightful to have what one needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, not only what one needs, but
      heaps and heaps of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[smiling]</span>.
      Nora, Nora, haven't you learned sense yet? In our schooldays you were a
      great spendthrift.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[laughing]</span>.
      Yes, that is what Torvald says now. <span class="stage-direction">[Wags
      her finger at her.]</span> But "Nora, Nora" is not so silly as you think.
      We have not been in a position for me to waste money. We have both had to
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. You too?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes; odds and ends, needlework,
      crotchet-work, embroidery, and that kind of thing. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Dropping her voice.]</span> And other things as
      well. You know Torvald left his office when we were married? There was no
      prospect of promotion there, and he had to try and earn more than before.
      But during the first year he over-worked himself dreadfully. You see, he
      had to make money every way he could, and he worked early and late; but he
      couldn't stand it, and fell dreadfully ill, and the doctors said it was
      necessary for him to go south.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. You spent a whole year in Italy,
      didn't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes. It was no easy matter to get
      away, I can tell you. It was just after Ivar was born; but naturally we
      had to go. It was a wonderfully beautiful journey, and it saved Torvald's
      life. But it cost a tremendous lot of money, Christine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. So I should think.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It cost about two hundred and fifty
      pounds. That's a lot, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, and in emergencies like
      that it is lucky to have the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I ought to tell you that we had it
      from papa.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Oh, I see. It was just about
      that time that he died, wasn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes; and, just think of it, I
      couldn't go and nurse him. I was expecting little Ivar's birth every day
      and I had my poor sick Torvald to look after. My dear, kind father--I
      never saw him again, Christine. That was the saddest time I have known
      since our marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I know how fond you were of him.
      And then you went off to Italy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes; you see we had money then, and
      the doctors insisted on our going, so we started a month later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. And your husband came back quite
      well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. As sound as a bell!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. But--the doctor?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What doctor?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I thought your maid said the
      gentleman who arrived here just as I did, was the doctor?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, that was Doctor Rank, but he
      doesn't come here professionally. He is our greatest friend, and comes in
      at least once every day. No, Torvald has not had an hour's illness since
      then, and our children are strong and healthy and so am I. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Jumps up and claps her hands.]</span> Christine!
      Christine! it's good to be alive and happy!--But how horrid of me; I am
      talking of nothing but my own affairs. <span class="stage-direction">[Sits
      on a stool near her, and rests her arms on her knees.]</span> You mustn't
      be angry with me. Tell me, is it really true that you did not love your
      husband? Why did you marry him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. My mother was alive then, and
      was bedridden and helpless, and I had to provide for my two younger
      brothers; so I did not think I was justified in refusing his offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, perhaps you were quite right. He
      was rich at that time, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I believe he was quite well off.
      But his business was a precarious one; and, when he died, it all went to
      pieces and there was nothing left.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And then?--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Well, I had to turn my hand to
      anything I could find--first a small shop, then a small school, and so on.
      The last three years have seemed like one long working-day, with no rest.
      Now it is at an end, Nora. My poor mother needs me no more, for she is
      gone; and the boys do not need me either; they have got situations and can
      shift for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What a relief you must feel if--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No, indeed; I only feel my life
      unspeakably empty. No one to live for anymore. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Gets up restlessly.]</span> That was why I could
      not stand the life in my little backwater any longer. I hope it may be
      easier here to find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts.
      If only I could have the good luck to get some regular work--office work
      of some kind--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. But, Christine, that is so
      frightfully tiring, and you look tired out now. You had far better go away
      to some watering-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[walking
      to the window]</span>. I have no father to give me money for a journey,
      Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[rising]</span>.
      Oh, don't be angry with me!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[going
      up to her]</span>. It is you that must not be angry with me, dear. The
      worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter. No one to
      work for, and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for chances. One
      must live, and so one becomes selfish. When you told me of the happy turn
      your fortunes have taken--you will hardly believe it--I was delighted not
      so much on your account as on my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. How do you mean?--Oh, I understand.
      You mean that perhaps Torvald could get you something to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, that was what I was
      thinking of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. He must, Christine. Just leave it to
      me; I will broach the subject very cleverly--I will think of something
      that will please him very much. It will make me so happy to be of some use
      to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. How kind you are, Nora, to be so
      anxious to help me! It is doubly kind in you, for you know so little of
      the burdens and troubles of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I--? I know so little of them?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[smiling]</span>.
      My dear! Small household cares and that sort of thing!--You are a child,
      Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[tosses
      her head and crosses the stage]</span>. You ought not to be so superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You are just like the others. They
      all think that I am incapable of anything really serious--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Come, come--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>.--that I have gone through nothing in
      this world of cares.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. But, my dear Nora, you have just
      told me all your troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Pooh!--those were trifles. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Lowering her voice.]</span> I have not told you
      the important thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. The important thing? What do you
      mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You look down upon me altogether,
      Christine--but you ought not to. You are proud, aren't you, of having
      worked so hard and so long for your mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Indeed, I don't look down on
      anyone. But it is true that I am both proud and glad to think that I was
      privileged to make the end of my mother's life almost free from care.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And you are proud to think of what
      you have done for your brothers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I think I have the right to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I think so, too. But now, listen to
      this; I too have something to be proud and glad of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I have no doubt you have. But
      what do you refer to?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Speak low. Suppose Torvald were to
      hear! He mustn't on any account--no one in the world must know, Christine,
      except you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. But what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Come here. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Pulls her down on the sofa beside her.]</span>
      Now I will show you that I too have something to be proud and glad of. It
      was I who saved Torvald's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. "Saved"? How?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I told you about our trip to Italy.
      Torvald would never have recovered if he had not gone there--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, but your father gave you
      the necessary funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[smiling]</span>.
      Yes, that is what Torvald and all the others think, but--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. But--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Papa didn't give us a shilling. It
      was I who procured the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. You? All that large sum?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Two hundred and fifty pounds. What do
      you think of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. But, Nora, how could you
      possibly do it? Did you win a prize in the Lottery?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[contemptuously]</span>.
      In the Lottery? There would have been no credit in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. But where did you get it from,
      then? Nora <span class="stage-direction">[humming and smiling with an air
      of mystery]</span>. Hm, hm! Aha!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Because you couldn't have
      borrowed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Couldn't I? Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No, a wife cannot borrow without
      her husband's consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[tossing
      her head]</span>. Oh, if it is a wife who has any head for business--a
      wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I don't understand it at all,
      Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. There is no need you should. I never
      said I had borrowed the money. I may have got it some other way. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Lies back on the sofa.]</span> Perhaps I got it
      from some other admirer. When anyone is as attractive as I am--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. You are a mad creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Now, you know you're full of
      curiosity, Christine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Listen to me, Nora dear. Haven't
      you been a little bit imprudent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[sits up
      straight]</span>. Is it imprudent to save your husband's life?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. It seems to me imprudent,
      without his knowledge, to--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. But it was absolutely necessary that
      he should not know! My goodness, can't you understand that? It was
      necessary he should have no idea what a dangerous condition he was in. It
      was to me that the doctors came and said that his life was in danger, and
      that the only thing to save him was to live in the south. Do you suppose I
      didn't try, first of all, to get what I wanted as if it were for myself? I
      told him how much I should love to travel abroad like other young wives; I
      tried tears and entreaties with him; I told him that he ought to remember
      the condition I was in, and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me;
      I even hinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry,
      Christine. He said I was thoughtless, and that it was his duty as my
      husband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices--as I believe he called
      them. Very well, I thought, you must be saved--and that was how I came to
      devise a way out of the difficulty--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. And did your husband never get
      to know from your father that the money had not come from him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, never. Papa died just at that
      time. I had meant to let him into the secret and beg him never to reveal
      it. But he was so ill then--alas, there never was any need to tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. And since then have you never
      told your secret to your husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Good Heavens, no! How could you think
      so? A man who has such strong opinions about these things! And besides,
      how painful and humiliating it would be for Torvald, with his manly
      independence, to know that he owed me anything! It would upset our mutual
      relations altogether; our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it
      is now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Do you mean never to tell him
      about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[meditatively,
      and with a half smile]</span>. Yes--someday, perhaps, after many years,
      when I am no longer as nice-looking as I am now. Don't laugh at me! I
      mean, of course, when Torvald is no longer as devoted to me as he is now;
      when my dancing and dressing-up and reciting have palled on him; then it
      may be a good thing to have something in reserve--<span
      class="stage-direction">[Breaking off.]</span> What nonsense! That time
      will never come. Now, what do you think of my great secret, Christine? Do
      you still think I am of no use? I can tell you, too, that this affair has
      caused me a lot of worry. It has been by no means easy for me to meet my
      engagements punctually. I may tell you that there is something that is
      called, in business, quarterly interest, and another thing called payment
      in installments, and it is always so dreadfully difficult to manage them.
      I have had to save a little here and there, where I could, you understand.
      I have not been able to put aside much from my housekeeping money, for
      Torvald must have a good table. I couldn't let my children be shabbily
      dressed; I have felt obliged to use up all he gave me for them, the sweet
      little darlings!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. So it has all had to come out of
      your own necessaries of life, poor Nora?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Of course. Besides, I was the one
      responsible for it. Whenever Torvald has given me money for new dresses
      and such things, I have never spent more than half of it; I have always
      bought the simplest and cheapest things. Thank Heaven, any clothes look
      well on me, and so Torvald has never noticed it. But it was often very
      hard on me, Christine--because it is delightful to be really well dressed,
      isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Quite so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Well, then I have found other ways of
      earning money. Last winter I was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to
      do; so I locked myself up and sat writing every evening until quite late
      at night. Many a time I was desperately tired; but all the same it was a
      tremendous pleasure to sit there working and earning money. It was like
      being a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. How much have you been able to
      pay off in that way?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I can't tell you exactly. You see, it
      is very difficult to keep an account of a business matter of that kind. I
      only know that I have paid every penny that I could scrape together. Many
      a time I was at my wits' end. <span class="stage-direction">[Smiles.]</span>
      Then I used to sit here and imagine that a rich old gentleman had fallen
      in love with me--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. What! Who was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Be quiet!--that he had died; and that
      when his will was opened it contained, written in big letters, the
      instruction: "The lovely Mrs Nora Helmer is to have all I possess paid
      over to her at once in cash."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. But, my dear Nora--who could the
      man be?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Good gracious, can't you understand?
      There was no old gentleman at all; it was only something that I used to
      sit here and imagine, when I couldn't think of any way of procuring money.
      But it's all the same now; the tiresome old person can stay where he is,
      as far as I am concerned; I don't care about him or his will either, for I
      am free from care now. <span class="stage-direction">[Jumps up.]</span> My
      goodness, it's delightful to think of, Christine! Free from care! To be
      able to be free from care, quite free from care; to be able to play and
      romp with the children; to be able to keep the house beautifully and have
      everything just as Torvald likes it! And, think of it, soon the spring
      will come and the big blue sky! Perhaps we shall be able to take a little
      trip--perhaps I shall see the sea again! Oh, it's a wonderful thing to be
      alive and be happy. <span class="stage-direction">[A bell is heard in the
      hall.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[rising]</span>.
      There is the bell; perhaps I had better go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, don't go; no one will come in
      here; it is sure to be for Torvald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Servant </span><span class="stage-direction">[at
      the hall door]</span>. Excuse me, ma'am--there is a gentleman to see the

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad </span><span class="stage-direction">[at

      is it? What do you want to see my husband about?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Bank business--in a way. I have a
      small post in the Bank, and I hear your husband is to be our chief now--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Then it is--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Nothing but dry business matters,
      Mrs Helmer; absolutely nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Be so good as to go into the study,
      then. <span class="stage-direction">[She bows indifferently to him and

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Nora--who was that man?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. A lawyer, of the name of Krogstad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Then it really was he.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Do you know the man?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I used to--many years ago. At
      one time he was a solicitor's clerk in our town.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. He is greatly altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. He made a very unhappy marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. He is a widower now, isn't he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. With several children. There now, it
      is burning up. [Shuts the door of the stove and moves the rocking-chair
      aside.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. They say he carries on various
      kinds of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Really! Perhaps he does; I don't know
      anything about it. But don't let us think of business; it is so tiresome.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Doctor Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[comes

      No, my dear fellow, I won't disturb you; I would rather go in to your wife

      Mrs LINDE.]</span> I beg your pardon; I am afraid I am disturbing you too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, not at all. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Introducing him]</span>. Doctor Rank, Mrs Linde.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. I have often heard Mrs Linde's name
      mentioned here. I think I passed you on the stairs when I arrived, Mrs
      Linde?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, I go up very slowly; I
      can't manage stairs well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Ah! some slight internal weakness?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No, the fact is I have been
      overworking myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Nothing more than that? Then I
      suppose you have come to town to amuse yourself with our entertainments?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I have come to look for work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Is that a good cure for overwork?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. One must live, Doctor Rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Yes, the general opinion seems to be
      that it is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Look here, Doctor Rank--you know you
      want to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Certainly. However wretched I may
      feel, I want to prolong the agony as long as possible. All my patients are
      like that. And so are those who are morally diseased; one of them, and a
      bad case too, is at this very moment with Helmer--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[sadly]</span>.
      Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Whom do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. A lawyer of the name of Krogstad, a
      fellow you don't know at all. He suffers from a diseased moral character,
      Mrs Helmer; but even he began talking of its being highly important that
      he should live.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Did he? What did he want to speak to
      Torvald about?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. I have no idea; I only heard that it
      was something about the Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I didn't know this--what's his
      name--Krogstad had anything to do with the Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Yes, he has some sort of appointment
      there. <span class="stage-direction">[To Mrs Linde.]</span> I don't know
      whether you find also in your part of the world that there are certain
      people who go zealously snuffing about to smell out moral corruption, and,
      as soon as they have found some, put the person concerned into some
      lucrative position where they can keep their eye on him. Healthy natures
      are left out in the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Still I think the sick are those
      who most need taking care of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[shrugging

    <p>

      any notion what Society really is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What do I care about tiresome
      Society? I am laughing at something quite different, something extremely
      amusing. Tell me, Doctor Rank, are all the people who are employed in the
      Bank dependent on Torvald now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Is that what you find so extremely
      amusing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[smiling
      and humming]</span>. That's my affair! <span class="stage-direction">[Walking

      Rank, what do you say to a macaroon?

    <p>

      forbidden here.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Oh, well, don't be alarmed! You
      couldn't know that Torvald had forbidden them. I must tell you that he is
      afraid they will spoil my teeth. But, bah!--once in a way--That's so,
      isn't it, Doctor Rank? By your leave! <span class="stage-direction">[Puts
      a macaroon into his mouth.]</span> You must have one too, Christine. And I
      shall have one, just a little one--or at most two. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Walking about.]</span> I am tremendously happy.
      There is just one thing in the world now that I should dearly love to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Well, what is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It's something I should dearly love
      to say, if Torvald could hear me.
    </p>

      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Well, why can't you say it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, I daren't; it's so shocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Shocking?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Well, I should not advise you to say
      it. Still, with us you might. What is it you would so much like to say if
      Torvald could hear you?

      since then.

    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No, really, I--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Christine is tremendously clever at
      book-keeping, and she is frightfully anxious to work under some clever
      man, so as to perfect herself--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Very sensible, Mrs Linde.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And when she heard you had been
      appointed manager of the Bank--the news was telegraphed, you know--she
      travelled here as quick as she could. Torvald, I am sure you will be able
      to do something for Christine, for my sake, won't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Well, it is not altogether
      impossible. I presume you are a widow, Mrs Linde?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And have had some experience of
      book-keeping?
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Ah! well, it's very likely I may be

    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Goodbye for the present. Of course
      you will come back this evening. And you too, Dr. Rank. What do you say?
      If you are well enough? Oh, you must be! Wrap yourself up well. <span
      class="stage-direction">[They go to the door all talking together.

    <p>

      cheeks like apples and roses. <span class="stage-direction">[The children
      all talk at once while she speaks to them.]</span> Have you had great fun?
      That's splendid! What, you pulled both Emmy and Bob along on the sledge?
      --both at once?--that was good. You are a clever boy, Ivar. Let me take
      her for a little, Anne. My sweet little baby doll! <span
      class="stage-direction">[Takes the baby from the MAID and dances it up and
      down.]</span> Yes, yes, mother will dance with Bob too. What! Have you
      been snowballing? I wish I had been there too! No, no, I will take their
      things off, Anne; please let me do it, it is such fun. Go in now, you look
      half frozen. There is some hot coffee for you on the stove.

    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Really! Did a big dog run after you?
      But it didn't bite you? No, dogs don't bite nice little dolly children.
      You mustn't look at the parcels, Ivar. What are they? Ah, I daresay you
      would like to know. No, no--it's something nasty! Come, let us have a
      game! What shall we play at? Hide and Seek? Yes, we'll play Hide and Seek.
      Bob shall hide first. Must I hide? Very well, I'll hide first. <span

      crawls forward and pretends to frighten them. Fresh laughter. Meanwhile
      there has been a knock at the hall door, but none of them has noticed it.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Excuse me, Mrs Helmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[with a

      you want?

      ajar; I suppose someone forgot to shut it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[rising]</span>.
      My husband is out, Mr. Krogstad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What do you want here, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. A word with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. With me?--<span
      class="stage-direction">[To the children, gently.]</span> Go in to nurse.
      What? No, the strange man won't do mother any harm. When he has gone we
      will have another game. <span class="stage-direction">[She takes the

      You want to speak to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Yes, I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Today? It is not the first of the
      month yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. No, it is Christmas Eve, and it
      will depend on yourself what sort of a Christmas you will spend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What do you mean? Today it is
      absolutely impossible for me--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. We won't talk about that until
      later on. This is something different. I presume you can give me a moment?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes--yes, I can--although--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Good. I was in Olsen's Restaurant
      and saw your husband going down the street--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. With a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. May I make so bold as to ask if
      it was a Mrs Linde?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Just arrived in town?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, today.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. She is a great friend of yours,
      isn't she?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. She is. But I don't see--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I knew her too, once upon a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I am aware of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Are you? So you know all about
      it; I thought as much. Then I can ask you, without beating about the
      bush--is Mrs Linde to have an appointment in the Bank?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What right have you to question me,
      Mr. Krogstad?--You, one of my husband's subordinates! But since you ask,
      you shall know. Yes, Mrs Linde is to have an appointment. And it was I who
      pleaded her cause, Mr. Krogstad, let me tell you that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I was right in what I thought,
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[walking
      up and down the stage]</span>. Sometimes one has a tiny little bit of
      influence, I should hope. Because one is a woman, it does not necessarily
      follow that--. When anyone is in a subordinate position, Mr. Krogstad,
      they should really be careful to avoid offending anyone who--who--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Who has influence?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad </span><span class="stage-direction">[changing
      his tone]</span>. Mrs Helmer, you will be so good as to use your influence
      on my behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What? What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. You will be so kind as to see
      that I am allowed to keep my subordinate position in the Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What do you mean by that? Who
      proposes to take your post away from you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Oh, there is no necessity to keep
      up the pretence of ignorance. I can quite understand that your friend is
      not very anxious to expose herself to the chance of rubbing shoulders with
      me; and I quite understand, too, whom I have to thank for being turned
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. But I assure you--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Very likely; but, to come to the
      point, the time has come when I should advise you to use your influence to
      prevent that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. But, Mr. Krogstad, I have no
      influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Haven't you? I thought you said
      yourself just now--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Naturally I did not mean you to put
      that construction on it. I! What should make you think I have any
      influence of that kind with my husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Oh, I have known your husband
      from our student days. I don't suppose he is any more unassailable than
      other husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. If you speak slightingly of my
      husband, I shall turn you out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. You are bold, Mrs Helmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I am not afraid of you any longer. As
      soon as the New Year comes, I shall in a very short time be free of the
      whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad </span><span class="stage-direction">[controlling
      himself]</span>. Listen to me, Mrs Helmer. If necessary, I am prepared to
      fight for my small post in the Bank as if I were fighting for my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. So it seems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. It is not only for the sake of
      the money; indeed, that weighs least with me in the matter. There is
      another reason--well, I may as well tell you. My position is this. I
      daresay you know, like everybody else, that once, many years ago, I was
      guilty of an indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I think I have heard something of the
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. The matter never came into court;
      but every way seemed to be closed to me after that. So I took to the
      business that you know of. I had to do something; and, honestly, I don't
      think I've been one of the worst. But now I must cut myself free from all
      that. My sons are growing up; for their sake I must try and win back as
      much respect as I can in the town. This post in the Bank was like the
      first step up for me--and now your husband is going to kick me downstairs
      again into the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. But you must believe me, Mr.
      Krogstad; it is not in my power to help you at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Then it is because you haven't
      the will; but I have means to compel you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You don't mean that you will tell my
      husband that I owe you money?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Hm!--suppose I were to tell him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It would be perfectly infamous of
      you. <span class="stage-direction">[Sobbing.]</span> To think of his
      learning my secret, which has been my joy and pride, in such an ugly,
      clumsy way--that he should learn it from you! And it would put me in a
      horribly disagreeable position--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Only disagreeable?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[impetuously]</span>.
      Well, do it, then!--and it will be the worse for you. My husband will see
      for himself what a blackguard you are, and you certainly won't keep your
      post then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I asked you if it was only a
      disagreeable scene at home that you were afraid of?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. If my husband does get to know of it,
      of course he will at once pay you what is still owing, and we shall have
      nothing more to do with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad </span><span class="stage-direction">[coming
      a step nearer]</span>. Listen to me, Mrs Helmer. Either you have a very
      bad memory or you know very little of business. I shall be obliged to
      remind you of a few details.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. When your husband was ill, you
      came to me to borrow two hundred and fifty pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I didn't know anyone else to go to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I promised to get you that
      amount--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, and you did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I promised to get you that
      amount, on certain conditions. Your mind was so taken up with your
      husband's illness, and you were so anxious to get the money for your
      journey, that you seem to have paid no attention to the conditions of our
      bargain. Therefore it will not be amiss if I remind you of them. Now, I
      promised to get the money on the security of a bond which I drew up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, and which I signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Good. But below your signature
      there were a few lines constituting your father a surety for the money;
      those lines your father should have signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Should? He did sign them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I had left the date blank; that
      is to say, your father should himself have inserted the date on which he
      signed the paper. Do you remember that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, I think I remember--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Then I gave you the bond to send
      by post to your father. Is that not so?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. And you naturally did so at once,
      because five or six days afterwards you brought me the bond with your
      father's signature. And then I gave you the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Well, haven't I been paying it off
      regularly?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Fairly so, yes. But--to come back
      to the matter in hand--that must have been a very trying time for you, Mrs
      Helmer?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It was, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Your father was very ill, wasn't
      he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. He was very near his end.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. And died soon afterwards?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Tell me, Mrs Helmer, can you by
      any chance remember what day your father died?--on what day of the month,
      I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Papa died on the 29th of September.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. That is correct; I have
      ascertained it for myself. And, as that is so, there is a discrepancy
      <span class="stage-direction">[taking a paper from his pocket]</span>
      which I cannot account for.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What discrepancy? I don't know--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. The discrepancy consists, Mrs
      Helmer, in the fact that your father signed this bond three days after his
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What do you mean? I don't
      understand--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Your father died on the 29th of
      September. But, look here; your father has dated his signature the 2nd of
      October. It is a discrepancy, isn't it? <span class="stage-direction">[NORA
      is silent.]</span> Can you explain it to me? <span class="stage-direction">[NORA
      is still silent.]</span> It is a remarkable thing, too, that the words
      "2nd of October," as well as the year, are not written in your father's
      handwriting but in one that I think I know. Well, of course it can be
      explained; your father may have forgotten to date his signature, and
      someone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his death.
      There is no harm in that. It all depends on the signature of the name; and
      that is genuine, I suppose, Mrs Helmer? It was your father himself who
      signed his name here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[after a
      short pause, throws her head up and looks defiantly at him]</span>. No, it
      was not. It was I that wrote papa's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Are you aware that is a dangerous
      confession?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. In what way? You shall have your
      money soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Let me ask you a question; why
      did you not send the paper to your father?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It was impossible; papa was so ill.
      If I had asked him for his signature, I should have had to tell him what
      the money was to be used for; and when he was so ill himself I couldn't
      tell him that my husband's life was in danger--it was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. It would have been better for you
      if you had given up your trip abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, that was impossible. That trip
      was to save my husband's life; I couldn't give that up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. But did it never occur to you
      that you were committing a fraud on me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I couldn't take that into account; I
      didn't trouble myself about you at all. I couldn't bear you, because you
      put so many heartless difficulties in my way, although you knew what a
      dangerous condition my husband was in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Mrs Helmer, you evidently do not
      realise clearly what it is that you have been guilty of. But I can assure
      you that my one false step, which lost me all my reputation, was nothing
      more or nothing worse than what you have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You? Do you ask me to believe that
      you were brave enough to run a risk to save your wife's life?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. The law cares nothing about
      motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Then it must be a very foolish law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Foolish or not, it is the law by
      which you will be judged, if I produce this paper in court.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I don't believe it. Is a daughter not
      to be allowed to spare her dying father anxiety and care? Is a wife not to
      be allowed to save her husband's life? I don't know much about law; but I
      am certain that there must be laws permitting such things as that. Have
      you no knowledge of such laws--you who are a lawyer? You must be a very
      poor lawyer, Mr. Krogstad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Maybe. But matters of
      business--such business as you and I have had together--do you think I
      don't understand that? Very well. Do as you please. But let me tell you
      this--if I lose my position a second time, you shall lose yours with me.

    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, dears, I know. But, don't tell
      anyone about the stranger man. Do you hear? Not even papa.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Children</span>. No, mother; but will you come and

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, no,--not now.

      <span class="character">Children</span>. But, mother, you promised us.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Here? No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. That is strange. I saw Krogstad
      going out of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Did you? Oh yes, I forgot, Krogstad
      was here for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora, I can see from your manner
      that he has been here begging you to say a good word for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And you were to appear to do it of
      your own accord; you were to conceal from me the fact of his having been
      here; didn't he beg that of you too?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, Torvald, but--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora, Nora, and you would be a
      party to that sort of thing? To have any talk with a man like that, and
      give him any sort of promise? And to tell me a lie into the bargain?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. A lie--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Didn't you tell me no one had been
      here? <span class="stage-direction">[Shakes his finger at her.]</span> My

      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[after a

      Torvald!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I am looking forward tremendously to
      the fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs' the day after tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And I am tremendously curious to
      see what you are going to surprise me with.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It was very silly of me to want to do
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I can't hit upon anything that will
      do; everything I think of seems so silly and insignificant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Does my little Nora acknowledge
      that at last?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[standing
      behind his chair with her arms on the back of it]</span>. Are you very
      busy, Torvald?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Well--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What are all those papers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Bank business.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Already?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. I have got authority from the
      retiring manager to undertake the necessary changes in the staff and in
      the rearrangement of the work; and I must make use of the Christmas week
      for that, so as to have everything in order for the new year.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Then that was why this poor
      Krogstad--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Hm!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[leans
      against the back of his chair and strokes his hair]</span>. If you hadn't
      been so busy I should have asked you a tremendously big favour, Torvald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What is that? Tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. There is no one has such good taste
      as you. And I do so want to look nice at the fancy-dress ball. Torvald,
      couldn't you take me in hand and decide what I shall go as, and what sort
      of a dress I shall wear?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Aha! so my obstinate little woman
      is obliged to get someone to come to her rescue?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, Torvald, I can't get along a bit
      without your help.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Very well, I will think it over, we
      shall manage to hit upon something.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. That is nice of you. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Goes to the Christmas Tree. A short pause.]</span>
      How pretty the red flowers look--. But, tell me, was it really something
      very bad that this Krogstad was guilty of?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. He forged someone's name. Have you
      any idea what that means?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Isn't it possible that he was driven
      to do it by necessity?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Yes; or, as in so many cases, by
      imprudence. I am not so heartless as to condemn a man altogether because
      of a single false step of that kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, you wouldn't, would you, Torvald?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Many a man has been able to
      retrieve his character, if he has openly confessed his fault and taken his
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Punishment--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But Krogstad did nothing of that
      sort; he got himself out of it by a cunning trick, and that is why he has
      gone under altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. But do you think it would--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Just think how a guilty man like
      that has to lie and play the hypocrite with every one, how he has to wear
      a mask in the presence of those near and dear to him, even before his own
      wife and children. And about the children--that is the most terrible part
      of it all, Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. How?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Because such an atmosphere of lies
      infects and poisons the whole life of a home. Each breath the children
      take in such a house is full of the germs of evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[coming
      nearer him]</span>. Are you sure of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. My dear, I have often seen it in
      the course of my life as a lawyer. Almost everyone who has gone to the bad
      early in life has had a deceitful mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Why do you only say--mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. It seems most commonly to be the
      mother's influence, though naturally a bad father's would have the same
      result. Every lawyer is familiar with the fact. This Krogstad, now, has
      been persistently poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation;
      that is why I say he has lost all moral character. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Holds out his hands to her.]</span> That is why
      my sweet little Nora must promise me not to plead his cause. Give me your
      hand on it. Come, come, what is this? Give me your hand. There now, that's
      settled. I assure you it would be quite impossible for me to work with
      him; I literally feel physically ill when I am in the company of such
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[takes
      her hand out of his and goes to the opposite side of the Christmas Tree]</span>.
      How hot it is in here; and I have such a lot to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[getting
      up and putting his papers in order]</span>. Yes, and I must try and read
      through some of these before dinner; and I must think about your costume,
      too. And it is just possible I may have something ready in gold paper to
      hang up on the Tree. <span class="stage-direction">[Puts his hand on her
      head.]</span> My precious little singing-bird! <span

    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[after a

    </p>
    <p>

      hundred thousand pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nurse</span>. What an idea! It can easily be put
      in order--just a little patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to
      come and help me with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nurse</span>. What, out again? In this horrible
      weather? You will catch cold, ma'am, and make yourself ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Well, worse than that might happen.
      How are the children?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nurse</span>. The poor little souls are playing
      with their Christmas presents, but--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Do they ask much for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nurse</span>. You see, they are so accustomed to
      have their mamma with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able
      to be so much with them now as I was before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nurse</span>. Oh well, young children easily get
      accustomed to anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Do you think so? Do you think they
      would forget their mother if she went away altogether?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nurse</span>. Good heavens!--went away altogether?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Nurse, I want you to tell me
      something I have often wondered about--how could you have the heart to put
      your own child out among strangers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nurse</span>. I was obliged to, if I wanted to be
      little Nora's nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, but how could you be willing to
      do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nurse</span>. What, when I was going to get such a
      good place by it? A poor girl who has got into trouble should be glad to.
      Besides, that wicked man didn't do a single thing for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. But I suppose your daughter has quite
      forgotten you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nurse</span>. No, indeed she hasn't. She wrote to
      me when she was confirmed, and when she was married.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[putting

      me when I was little.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nurse</span>. Little Nora, poor dear, had no other
      mother but me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And if my little ones had no other
      mother, I am sure you would--What nonsense I am talking! <span

      must--. You will see tomorrow how charming I shall look.
    </p>

      the ball so charming as you, ma'am. <span class="stage-direction">[Goes

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[begins

      Only I mustn't think about it. I will brush my muff. What lovely, lovely
      gloves! Out of my thoughts, out of my thoughts! One, two, three, four,
      five, six-- <span class="stage-direction">[Screams.]</span> Ah! there is

      one else out there, is there? How good of you to come!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I heard you were up asking for
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of
      fact, it is something you could help me with. Let us sit down here on the
      sofa. Look here. Tomorrow evening there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the
      Stenborgs', who live above us; and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan
      fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learned at Capri.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I see; you are going to keep up
      the character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here
      is the dress; Torvald had it made for me there, but now it is all so torn,
      and I haven't any idea--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. We will easily put that right.
      It is only some of the trimming come unsewn here and there. Needle and
      thread? Now then, that's all we want.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It is nice of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[sewing]</span>.
      So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow Nora. I will tell you what--I
      shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine feathers. But I have
      completely forgotten to thank you for a delightful evening yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[gets
      up, and crosses the stage]</span>. Well, I don't think yesterday was as
      pleasant as usual. You ought to have come to town a little earlier,
      Christine. Certainly Torvald does understand how to make a house dainty
      and attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. And so do you, it seems to me;
      you are not your father's daughter for nothing. But tell me, is Doctor
      Rank always as depressed as he was yesterday?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No; yesterday it was very noticeable.
      I must tell you that he suffers from a very dangerous disease. He has
      consumption of the spine, poor creature. His father was a horrible man who
      committed all sorts of excesses; and that is why his son was sickly from
      childhood, do you understand?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[dropping
      her sewing]</span>. But, my dearest Nora, how do you know anything about
      such things?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[walking
      about]</span>. Pooh! When you have three children, you get visits now and
      then from--from married women, who know something of medical matters, and
      they talk about one thing and another.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[goes
      on sewing. A short silence]</span>. Does Doctor Rank come here everyday?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Everyday regularly. He is Torvald's
      most intimate friend, and a great friend of mine too. He is just like one
      of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. But tell me this--is he
      perfectly sincere? I mean, isn't he the kind of man that is very anxious
      to make himself agreeable?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Not in the least. What makes you
      think that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. When you introduced him to me
      yesterday, he declared he had often heard my name mentioned in this house;
      but afterwards I noticed that your husband hadn't the slightest idea who I
      was. So how could Doctor Rank--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. That is quite right, Christine.
      Torvald is so absurdly fond of me that he wants me absolutely to himself,
      as he says. At first he used to seem almost jealous if I mentioned any of
      the dear folk at home, so naturally I gave up doing so. But I often talk
      about such things with Doctor Rank, because he likes hearing about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Listen to me, Nora. You are
      still very like a child in many things, and I am older than you in many
      ways and have a little more experience. Let me tell you this--you ought to
      make an end of it with Doctor Rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What ought I to make an end of?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Of two things, I think.
      Yesterday you talked some nonsense about a rich admirer who was to leave
      you money--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. An admirer who doesn't exist,
      unfortunately! But what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Is Doctor Rank a man of means?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. And has no one to provide for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, no one; but--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. And comes here everyday?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, I told you so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. But how can this well-bred man
      be so tactless?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I don't understand you at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Don't prevaricate, Nora. Do you
      suppose I don't guess who lent you the two hundred and fifty pounds?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Are you out of your senses? How can
      you think of such a thing! A friend of ours, who comes here everyday! Do
      you realise what a horribly painful position that would be?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Then it really isn't he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, certainly not. It would never
      have entered into my head for a moment. Besides, he had no money to lend
      then; he came into his money afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Well, I think that was lucky for
      you, my dear Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, it would never have come into my
      head to ask Doctor Rank. Although I am quite sure that if I had asked
      him--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. But of course you won't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Of course not. I have no reason to
      think it could possibly be necessary. But I am quite sure that if I told
      Doctor Rank--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Behind your husband's back?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I must make an end of it with the
      other one, and that will be behind his back too. I must make an end of it
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, that is what I told you
      yesterday, but--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[walking
      up and down]</span>. A man can put a thing like that straight much easier
      than a woman--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. One's husband, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Nonsense! <span
      class="stage-direction">[Standing still.]</span> When you pay off a debt
      you get your bond back, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, as a matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And can tear it into a hundred
      thousand pieces, and burn it up--the nasty dirty paper!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[looks
      hard at her, lays down her sewing and gets up slowly]</span>. Nora, you
      are concealing something from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Do I look as if I were?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Something has happened to you
      since yesterday morning. Nora, what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[going
      nearer to her]</span>. Christine! <span class="stage-direction">[Listens.]</span>
      Hush! there's Torvald come home. Do you mind going in to the children for
      the present? Torvald can't bear to see dressmaking going on. Let Anne help
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[gathering
      some of the things together]</span>. Certainly--but I am not going away
      from here until we have had it out with one another. <span
      class="stage-direction">[She goes into the room on the left, as HELMER
      comes in from the hall.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[going
      up to HELMER]</span>. I have wanted you so much, Torvald dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Was that the dressmaker?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, it was Christine; she is helping
      me to put my dress in order. You will see I shall look quite smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Wasn't that a happy thought of
      mine, now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Splendid! But don't you think it is
      nice of me, too, to do as you wish?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nice?--because you do as your
      husband wishes? Well, well, you little rogue, I am sure you did not mean
      it in that way. But I am not going to disturb you; you will want to be
      trying on your dress, I expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I suppose you are going to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Yes. <span class="stage-direction">[Shows
      her a bundle of papers.]</span> Look at that. I have just been into the
      bank. <span class="stage-direction">[Turns to go into his room.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Torvald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. If your little squirrel were to ask
      you for something very, very prettily--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Would you do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. I should like to hear what it is,
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Your squirrel would run about and do
      all her tricks if you would be nice, and do what she wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Speak plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Your skylark would chirp about in
      every room, with her song rising and falling--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Well, my skylark does that anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I would play the fairy and dance for
      you in the moonlight, Torvald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora--you surely don't mean that
      request you made to me this morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[going
      near him]</span>. Yes, Torvald, I beg you so earnestly--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Have you really the courage to open
      up that question again?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, dear, you must do as I ask; you
      must let Krogstad keep his post in the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. My dear Nora, it is his post that I
      have arranged Mrs Linde shall have.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, you have been awfully kind about
      that; but you could just as well dismiss some other clerk instead of
      Krogstad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. This is simply incredible
      obstinacy! Because you chose to give him a thoughtless promise that you
      would speak for him, I am expected to--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. That isn't the reason, Torvald. It is
      for your own sake. This fellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers;
      you have told me so yourself. He can do you an unspeakable amount of harm.
      I am frightened to death of him--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Ah, I understand; it is
      recollections of the past that scare you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Naturally you are thinking of your
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes--yes, of course. Just recall to
      your mind what these malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa,
      and how horribly they slandered him. I believe they would have procured
      his dismissal if the Department had not sent you over to inquire into it,
      and if you had not been so kindly disposed and helpful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. My little Nora, there is an
      important difference between your father and me. Your father's reputation
      as a public official was not above suspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will
      continue to be so, as long as I hold my office.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You never can tell what mischief
      these men may contrive. We ought to be so well off, so snug and happy here
      in our peaceful home, and have no cares--you and I and the children,
      Torvald! That is why I beg you so earnestly--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And it is just by interceding for
      him that you make it impossible for me to keep him. It is already known at
      the Bank that I mean to dismiss Krogstad. Is it to get about now that the
      new manager has changed his mind at his wife's bidding--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And what if it did?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Of course!--if only this obstinate
      little person can get her way! Do you suppose I am going to make myself
      ridiculous before my whole staff, to let people think that I am a man to
      be swayed by all sorts of outside influence? I should very soon feel the
      consequences of it, I can tell you! And besides, there is one thing that
      makes it quite impossible for me to have Krogstad in the Bank as long as I
      am manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Whatever is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. His moral failings I might perhaps
      have overlooked, if necessary--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, you could--couldn't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And I hear he is a good worker,
      too. But I knew him when we were boys. It was one of those rash
      friendships that so often prove an incubus in afterlife. I may as well
      tell you plainly, we were once on very intimate terms with one another.
      But this tactless fellow lays no restraint on himself when other people
      are present. On the contrary, he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a
      familiar tone with me, and every minute it is "I say, Helmer, old fellow!"
      and that sort of thing. I assure you it is extremely painful for me. He
      would make my position in the Bank intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Torvald, I don't believe you mean
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Don't you? Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Because it is such a narrow-minded
      way of looking at things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What are you saying? Narrow-minded?
      Do you think I am narrow-minded?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, just the opposite, dear--and it
      is exactly for that reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. It's the same thing. You say my
      point of view is narrow-minded, so I must be so too. Narrow-minded! Very
      well--I must put an end to this. <span class="stage-direction">[Goes to
      the hall door and calls.]</span> Helen!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What are you going to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[looking
      among his papers]</span>. Settle it. <span class="stage-direction">[Enter
      MAID.]</span> Look here; take this letter and go downstairs with it at
      once. Find a messenger and tell him to deliver it, and be quick. The
      address is on it, and here is the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Maid</span>. Very well, sir. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Exit with the letter.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[putting
      his papers together]</span>. Now then, little Miss Obstinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[breathlessly]</span>.
      Torvald--what was that letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Krogstad's dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Call her back, Torvald! There is
      still time. Oh Torvald, call her back! Do it for my sake--for your own
      sake--for the children's sake! Do you hear me, Torvald? Call her back! You
      don't know what that letter can bring upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. It's too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, it's too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. My dear Nora, I can forgive the
      anxiety you are in, although really it is an insult to me. It is, indeed.
      Isn't it an insult to think that I should be afraid of a starving
      quill-driver's vengeance? But I forgive you nevertheless, because it is
      such eloquent witness to your great love for me. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Takes her in his arms.]</span> And that is as it
      should be, my own darling Nora. Come what will, you may be sure I shall
      have both courage and strength if they be needed. You will see I am man
      enough to take everything upon myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[in a
      horror-stricken voice]</span>. What do you mean by that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Everything, I say--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[recovering
      herself]</span>. You will never have to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. That's right. Well, we will share
      it, Nora, as man and wife should. That is how it shall be. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Caressing her.]</span> Are you content now?
      There! There!--not these frightened dove's eyes! The whole thing is only
      the wildest fancy!--Now, you must go and play through the Tarantella and
      practise with your tambourine. I shall go into the inner office and shut
      the door, and I shall hear nothing; you can make as much noise as you
      please. <span class="stage-direction">[Turns back at the door.]</span> And
      when Rank comes, tell him where he will find me. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Nods to her, takes his papers and goes into his

      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[bewildered

      was capable of doing it. He will do it. He will do it in spite of

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Good day, Doctor Rank. I knew your
      ring. But you mustn't go in to Torvald now; I think he is busy with
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. And you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[brings
      him in and shuts the door after him]</span>. Oh, you know very well I
      always have time for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Thank you. I shall make use of as
      much of it as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What do you mean by that? As much of
      it as you can?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Well, does that alarm you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It was such a strange way of putting
      it. Is anything likely to happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Nothing but what I have long been
      prepared for. But I certainly didn't expect it to happen so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[gripping
      him by the arm]</span>. What have you found out? Doctor Rank, you must
      tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[sitting
      down by the stove]</span>. It is all up with me. And it can't be helped.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[with a
      sigh of relief]</span>. Is it about yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Who else? It is no use lying to one's
      self. I am the most wretched of all my patients, Mrs Helmer. Lately I have
      been taking stock of my internal economy. Bankrupt! Probably within a
      month I shall lie rotting in the churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What an ugly thing to say!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. The thing itself is cursedly ugly,
      and the worst of it is that I shall have to face so much more that is ugly
      before that. I shall only make one more examination of myself; when I have
      done that, I shall know pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors
      of dissolution will begin. There is something I want to tell you. Helmer's
      refined nature gives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is
      ugly; I won't have him in my sick-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Oh, but, Doctor Rank--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. I won't have him there. Not on any
      account. I bar my door to him. As soon as I am quite certain that the
      worst has come, I shall send you my card with a black cross on it, and
      then you will know that the loathsome end has begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You are quite absurd today. And I
      wanted you so much to be in a really good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. With death stalking beside me?--To
      have to pay this penalty for another man's sin? Is there any justice in
      that? And in every single family, in one way or another, some such
      inexorable retribution is being exacted--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[putting
      her hands over her ears]</span>. Rubbish! Do talk of something cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Oh, it's a mere laughing matter, the
      whole thing. My poor innocent spine has to suffer for my father's youthful
      amusements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[sitting
      at the table on the left]</span>. I suppose you mean that he was too
      partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Yes, and to truffles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Truffles, yes. And oysters too, I
      suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Oysters, of course, that goes without
      saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And heaps of port and champagne. It
      is sad that all these nice things should take their revenge on our bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Especially that they should revenge
      themselves on the unlucky bones of those who have not had the satisfaction
      of enjoying them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, that's the saddest part of it
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[with a
      searching look at her]</span>. Hm!--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[after a
      short pause]</span>. Why did you smile?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. No, it was you that laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, it was you that smiled, Doctor
      Rank!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[rising]</span>.
      You are a greater rascal than I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I am in a silly mood today.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. So it seems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[putting
      her hands on his shoulders]</span>. Dear, dear Doctor Rank, death mustn't
      take you away from Torvald and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. It is a loss you would easily recover
      from. Those who are gone are soon forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[looking
      at him anxiously]</span>. Do you believe that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. People form new ties, and then--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Who will form new ties?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Both you and Helmer, when I am gone.
      You yourself are already on the high road to it, I think. What did that
      Mrs Linde want here last night?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Oho!--you don't mean to say you are
      jealous of poor Christine?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Yes, I am. She will be my successor
      in this house. When I am done for, this woman will--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Hush! don't speak so loud. She is in
      that room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Today again. There, you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. She has only come to sew my dress for
      me. Bless my soul, how unreasonable you are! <span class="stage-direction">[Sits
      down on the sofa.]</span> Be nice now, Doctor Rank, and tomorrow you will
      see how beautifully I shall dance, and you can imagine I am doing it all
      for you--and for Torvald too, of course. <span class="stage-direction">[Takes
      various things out of the box.]</span> Doctor Rank, come and sit down
      here, and I will show you something.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[sitting
      down]</span>. What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Just look at those!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Silk stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Flesh-coloured. Aren't they lovely?
      It is so dark here now, but tomorrow--. No, no, no! you must only look at
      the feet. Oh well, you may have leave to look at the legs too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Hm!--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Why are you looking so critical?
      Don't you think they will fit me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. I have no means of forming an opinion
      about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[looks
      at him for a moment]</span>. For shame! <span class="stage-direction">[Hits
      him lightly on the ear with the stockings.]</span> That's to punish you.
      <span class="stage-direction">[Folds them up again.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. And what other nice things am I to be
      allowed to see?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Not a single thing more, for being so
      naughty. <span class="stage-direction">[She looks among the things,
      humming to herself.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[after a
      short silence]</span>. When I am sitting here, talking to you as
      intimately as this, I cannot imagine for a moment what would have become
      of me if I had never come into this house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[smiling]</span>.
      I believe you do feel thoroughly at home with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[in a
      lower voice, looking straight in front of him]</span>. And to be obliged
      to leave it all--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Nonsense, you are not going to leave
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[as
      before]</span>. And not be able to leave behind one the slightest token of
      one's gratitude, scarcely even a fleeting regret--nothing but an empty
      place which the first comer can fill as well as any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And if I asked you now for a--? No!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. For what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. For a big proof of your friendship--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Yes, yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I mean a tremendously big favour--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Would you really make me so happy for
      once?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Ah, but you don't know what it is
      yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. No--but tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I really can't, Doctor Rank. It is
      something out of all reason; it means advice, and help, and a favour--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. The bigger a thing it is the better.
      I can't conceive what it is you mean. Do tell me. Haven't I your
      confidence?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. More than anyone else. I know you are
      my truest and best friend, and so I will tell you what it is. Well, Doctor
      Rank, it is something you must help me to prevent. You know how devotedly,
      how inexpressibly deeply Torvald loves me; he would never for a moment
      hesitate to give his life for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[leaning
      towards her]</span>. Nora--do you think he is the only one--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[with a
      slight start]</span>. The only one--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. The only one who would gladly give
      his life for your sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[sadly]</span>.
      Is that it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. I was determined you should know it
      before I went away, and there will never be a better opportunity than
      this. Now you know it, Nora. And now you know, too, that you can trust me
      as you would trust no one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[rises,
      deliberately and quietly]</span>. Let me pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[makes
      room for her to pass him, but sits still]</span>. Nora!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[at the
      hall door]</span>. Helen, bring in the lamp. <span class="stage-direction">[Goes
      over to the stove.]</span> Dear Doctor Rank, that was really horrid of
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. To have loved you as much as anyone
      else does? Was that horrid?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, but to go and tell me so. There
      was really no need--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. What do you mean? Did you know--?
      <span class="stage-direction">[MAID enters with lamp, puts it down on the
      table, and goes out.]</span> Nora--Mrs Helmer--tell me, had you any idea
      of this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Oh, how do I know whether I had or
      whether I hadn't? I really can't tell you--To think you could be so
      clumsy, Doctor Rank! We were getting on so nicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Well, at all events you know now that
      you can command me, body and soul. So won't you speak out?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[looking
      at him]</span>. After what happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. I beg you to let me know what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I can't tell you anything now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Yes, yes. You mustn't punish me in
      that way. Let me have permission to do for you whatever a man may do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You can do nothing for me now.
      Besides, I really don't need any help at all. You will find that the whole
      thing is merely fancy on my part. It really is so--of course it is! <span
      class="stage-direction">[Sits down in the rocking-chair, and looks at him
      with a smile.]</span> You are a nice sort of man, Doctor Rank!--don't you
      feel ashamed of yourself, now the lamp has come?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Not a bit. But perhaps I had better
      go--for ever?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, indeed, you shall not. Of course
      you must come here just as before. You know very well Torvald can't do
      without you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Yes, but you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Oh, I am always tremendously pleased
      when you come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. It is just that, that put me on the
      wrong track. You are a riddle to me. I have often thought that you would
      almost as soon be in my company as in Helmer's.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes--you see there are some people
      one loves best, and others whom one would almost always rather have as
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Yes, there is something in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. When I was at home, of course I loved
      papa best. But I always thought it tremendous fun if I could steal down
      into the maids' room, because they never moralised at all, and talked to
      each other about such entertaining things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. I see--it is their place I have
      taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[jumping
      up and going to him]</span>. Oh, dear, nice Doctor Rank, I never meant
      that at all. But surely you can understand that being with Torvald is a
      little like being with papa--<span class="stage-direction">[Enter MAID
      from the hall.]</span>

    <p>
      <span class="character">Maid</span>. If you please, ma'am. <span

      pocket.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Is there anything wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, no, not in the least. It is only
      something--it is my new dress--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. What? Your dress is lying there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Oh, yes, that one; but this is
      another. I ordered it. Torvald mustn't know about it--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Oho! Then that was the great secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Of course. Just go in to him; he is
      sitting in the inner room. Keep him as long as--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Make your mind easy; I won't let him
      escape.
    </p>

      MAID]</span>. And he is standing waiting in the kitchen?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Maid</span>. Yes; he came up the back stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. But didn't you tell him no one was
      in?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Maid</span>. Yes, but it was no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. He won't go away?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Maid</span>. No; he says he won't until he has
      seen you, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Well, let him come in--but quietly.
      Helen, you mustn't say anything about it to anyone. It is a surprise for
      my husband.

    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. An explanation of something.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Make haste then. What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. You know, I suppose, that I have
      got my dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I couldn't prevent it, Mr. Krogstad.
      I fought as hard as I could on your side, but it was no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Does your husband love you so
      little, then? He knows what I can expose you to, and yet he ventures--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. How can you suppose that he has any
      knowledge of the sort?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I didn't suppose so at all. It
      would not be the least like our dear Torvald Helmer to show so much
      courage--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Mr. Krogstad, a little respect for my
      husband, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Certainly--all the respect he
      deserves. But since you have kept the matter so carefully to yourself, I
      make bold to suppose that you have a little clearer idea, than you had
      yesterday, of what it actually is that you have done?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. More than you could ever teach me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Yes, such a bad lawyer as I am.
    </p>

      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What is it you want of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Only to see how you were, Mrs
      Helmer. I have been thinking about you all day long. A mere cashier, a
      quill-driver, a--well, a man like me--even he has a little of what is
      called feeling, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Show it, then; think of my little
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Have you and your husband thought
      of mine? But never mind about that. I only wanted to tell you that you
      need not take this matter too seriously. In the first place there will be
      no accusation made on my part.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, of course not; I was sure of
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. The whole thing can be arranged
      amicably; there is no reason why anyone should know anything about it. It
      will remain a secret between us three.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. My husband must never get to know
      anything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. How will you be able to prevent
      it? Am I to understand that you can pay the balance that is owing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, not just at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Or perhaps that you have some
      expedient for raising the money soon?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No expedient that I mean to make use
      of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Well, in any case, it would have
      been of no use to you now. If you stood there with ever so much money in
      your hand, I would never part with your bond.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Tell me what purpose you mean to put
      it to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I shall only preserve it--keep it
      in my possession. No one who is not concerned in the matter shall have the
      slightest hint of it. So that if the thought of it has driven you to any
      desperate resolution--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It has.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. If you had it in your mind to run
      away from your home--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I had.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Or even something worse--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. How could you know that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Give up the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. How did you know I had thought of
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Most of us think of that at
      first. I did, too--but I hadn't the courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[faintly]</span>.
      No more had I.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad </span><span class="stage-direction">[in
      a tone of relief]</span>. No, that's it, isn't it--you hadn't the courage
      either?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, I haven't--I haven't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Besides, it would have been a
      great piece of folly. Once the first storm at home is over--. I have a
      letter for your husband in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Telling him everything?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. In as lenient a manner as I
      possibly could.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[quickly]</span>.
      He mustn't get the letter. Tear it up. I will find some means of getting
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Excuse me, Mrs Helmer, but I
      think I told you just now--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I am not speaking of what I owe you.
      Tell me what sum you are asking my husband for, and I will get the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I am not asking your husband for
      a penny.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What do you want, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I will tell you. I want to
      rehabilitate myself, Mrs Helmer; I want to get on; and in that your
      husband must help me. For the last year and a half I have not had a hand
      in anything dishonourable, amid all that time I have been struggling in
      most restricted circumstances. I was content to work my way up step by
      step. Now I am turned out, and I am not going to be satisfied with merely
      being taken into favour again. I want to get on, I tell you. I want to get
      into the Bank again, in a higher position. Your husband must make a place
      for me--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. That he will never do!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. He will; I know him; he dare not
      protest. And as soon as I am in there again with him, then you will see!
      Within a year I shall be the manager's right hand. It will be Nils
      Krogstad and not Torvald Helmer who manages the Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. That's a thing you will never see!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Do you mean that you will--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I have courage enough for it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Oh, you can't frighten me. A
      fine, spoilt lady like you--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You will see, you will see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Under the ice, perhaps? Down into
      the cold, coal-black water? And then, in the spring, to float up to the surface,
      all horrible and unrecognisable, with your hair fallen out--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You can't frighten me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Nor you me. People don't do such
      things, Mrs Helmer. Besides, what use would it be? I should have him
      completely in my power all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Afterwards? When I am no longer--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Have you forgotten that it is I
      who have the keeping of your reputation? <span class="stage-direction">[NORA
      stands speechlessly looking at him.]</span> Well, now, I have warned you.
      Do not do anything foolish. When Helmer has had my letter, I shall expect
      a message from him. And be sure you remember that it is your husband
      himself who has forced me into such ways as this again. I will never
      forgive him for that. Goodbye, Mrs Helmer. <span class="stage-direction">[Exit
      through the hall.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[goes to
      the hall door, opens it slightly and listens.]</span> He is going. He is
      not putting the letter in the box. Oh no, no! that's impossible! <span
      class="stage-direction">[Opens the door by degrees.]</span> What is that?
      He is standing outside. He is not going downstairs. Is he hesitating? Can
      he--? <span class="stage-direction">[A letter drops into the box; then

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. In the letter-box. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Steals across to the hall door.]</span> There it
      lies--Torvald, Torvald, there is no hope for us now!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="stage-direction">[Mrs Linde comes in from the room on the
      left, carrying the dress.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. There, I can't see anything more
      to mend now. Would you like to try it on--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[in a
      hoarse whisper]</span>. Christine, come here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[throwing
      the dress down on the sofa]</span>. What is the matter with you? You look
      so agitated!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Come here. Do you see that letter?
      There, look--you can see it through the glass in the letter-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, I see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. That letter is from Krogstad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Nora--it was Krogstad who lent
      you the money!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, and now Torvald will know all
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Believe me, Nora, that's the
      best thing for both of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You don't know all. I forged a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Good heavens--!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I only want to say this to you,
      Christine--you must be my witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Your witness? What do you mean?
      What am I to--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. If I should go out of my mind--and it
      might easily happen--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Nora!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Or if anything else should happen to
      me--anything, for instance, that might prevent my being here--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Nora! Nora! you are quite out of
      your mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And if it should happen that there
      were some one who wanted to take all the responsibility, all the blame,
      you understand--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, yes--but how can you
      suppose--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Then you must be my witness, that it
      is not true, Christine. I am not out of my mind at all; I am in my right
      senses now, and I tell you no one else has known anything about it; I, and
      I alone, did the whole thing. Remember that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I will, indeed. But I don't
      understand all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. How should you understand it? A
      wonderful thing is going to happen!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. A wonderful thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, a wonderful thing!--But it is so
      terrible, Christine; it mustn't happen, not for all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I will go at once and see
      Krogstad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Don't go to him; he will do you some
      harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. There was a time when he would
      gladly do anything for my sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. He?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Where does he live?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. How should I know--? Yes <span
      class="stage-direction">[feeling in her pocket]</span>, here is his card.
      But the letter, the letter--!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[calls
      from his room, knocking at the door]</span>. Nora! Nora <span
      class="stage-direction">[cries out anxiously]</span>. Oh, what's that?
      What do you want?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Don't be so frightened. We are not
      coming in; you have locked the door. Are you trying on your dress?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, that's it. I look so nice,
      Torvald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[who
      has read the card]</span>. I see he lives at the corner here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, but it's no use. It is hopeless.
      The letter is lying there in the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. And your husband keeps the key?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, always.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Krogstad must ask for his letter
      back unread, he must find some pretence--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. But it is just at this time that
      Torvald generally--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. You must delay him. Go in to him
      in the meantime. I will come back as soon as I can. <span
      class="stage-direction">[She goes out hurriedly through the hall door.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[goes to
      HELMER'S door, opens it and peeps in]</span>. Torvald!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[from
      the inner room]</span>. Well? May I venture at last to come into my own
      room again? Come along, Rank, now you will see-- <span
      class="stage-direction">[Halting in the doorway.]</span> But what is this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What is what, dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Rank led me to expect a splendid
      transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[in the
      doorway]</span>. I understood so, but evidently I was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, nobody is to have the chance of
      admiring me in my dress until tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But, my dear Nora, you look so worn
      out. Have you been practising too much?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, I have not practised at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But you will need to--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, indeed I shall, Torvald. But I
      can't get on a bit without you to help me; I have absolutely forgotten the
      whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Oh, we will soon work it up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, help me, Torvald. Promise that
      you will! I am so nervous about it--all the people--. You must give
      yourself up to me entirely this evening. Not the tiniest bit of
      business--you mustn't even take a pen in your hand. Will you promise,
      Torvald dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. I promise. This evening I will be
      wholly and absolutely at your service, you helpless little mortal. Ah, by
      the way, first of all I will just-- <span class="stage-direction">[Goes
      towards the hall door.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What are you going to do there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Only see if any letters have come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, no! don't do that, Torvald!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Torvald, please don't. There is
      nothing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Well, let me look. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Turns to go to the letter-box. NORA, at the
      piano, plays the first bars of the Tarantella. HELMER stops in the

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I can't dance tomorrow if I don't
      practise with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[going

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, so dreadfully afraid of it. Let
      me practise at once; there is time now, before we go to dinner. Sit down
      and play for me, Torvald dear; criticise me, and correct me as you play.
    </p>

      to. <span class="stage-direction">[Sits down at the piano.]</span>

      Stop, I tell you! <span class="stage-direction">[RANK stops playing, and

      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[throwing

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You will want a lot of coaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, you see how much I need it. You
      must coach me up to the last minute. Promise me that, Torvald!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You can depend on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You must not think of anything but
      me, either today or tomorrow; you mustn't open a single letter--not even
      open the letter-box--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Ah, you are still afraid of that
      fellow--

    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, indeed I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora, I can tell from your looks
      that there is a letter from him lying there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I don't know; I think there is; but
      you must not read anything of that kind now. Nothing horrid must come
      between us until this is all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[whispers

    <p>

      nervous. Be my own little skylark, as you used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, dear, I will. But go in now and
      you too, Doctor Rank. Christine, you must help me to do up my hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[whispers

      expecting anything?

    <p>

      simply nothing more than this childish nervousness I was telling you of.

      evening. I wrote a note for him.

    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You should have let it alone; you
      must prevent nothing. After all, it is splendid to be waiting for a
      wonderful thing to happen.

      for?

      ACT III
    </h3>
    <p>
      <span class="stage-direction">[THE SAME SCENE.--The table has been placed
      in the middle of the stage, with chairs around it. A lamp is burning on
      the table. The door into the hall stands open. Dance music is heard in the
      room above. Mrs Linde is sitting at the table idly turning over the leaves
      of a book; she tries to read, but does not seem able to collect her
      thoughts. Every now and then she listens intently for a sound at the outer
      door.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[looking
      at her watch]</span>. Not yet--and the time is nearly up. If only he does
      not--. <span class="stage-direction">[Listens again.]</span> Ah, there he
      is. <span class="stage-direction">[Goes into the hall and opens the outer
      door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the stairs. She whispers.]</span>
      Come in. There is no one here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad </span><span class="stage-direction">[in
      the doorway]</span>. I found a note from you at home. What does this mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. It is absolutely necessary that
      I should have a talk with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Really? And is it absolutely
      necessary that it should be here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. It is impossible where I live;
      there is no private entrance to my rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The
      maid is asleep, and the Helmers are at the dance upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad </span><span class="stage-direction">[coming
      into the room]</span>. Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Certainly--why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Now, Nils, let us have a talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Can we two have anything to talk
      about?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. We have a great deal to talk
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I shouldn't have thought so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No, you have never properly
      understood me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Was there anything else to
      understand except what was obvious to all the world--a heartless woman
      jilts a man when a more lucrative chance turns up?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Do you believe I am as
      absolutely heartless as all that? And do you believe that I did it with a
      light heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Didn't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Nils, did you really think that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. If it were as you say, why did
      you write to me as you did at the time?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I could do nothing else. As I
      had to break with you, it was my duty also to put an end to all that you
      felt for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad </span><span class="stage-direction">[wringing
      his hands]</span>. So that was it. And all this--only for the sake of
      money!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. You must not forget that I had a
      helpless mother and two little brothers. We couldn't wait for you, Nils;
      your prospects seemed hopeless then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. That may be so, but you had no
      right to throw me over for anyone else's sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Indeed I don't know. Many a time
      did I ask myself if I had the right to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad </span><span class="stage-direction">[more
      gently]</span>. When I lost you, it was as if all the solid ground went
      from under my feet. Look at me now--I am a shipwrecked man clinging to a
      bit of wreckage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. But help may be near.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. It was near; but then you came
      and stood in my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Unintentionally, Nils. It was
      only today that I learned it was your place I was going to take in the
      Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I believe you, if you say so. But
      now that you know it, are you not going to give it up to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No, because that would not
      benefit you in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Oh, benefit, benefit--I would
      have done it whether or no.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I have learned to act prudently.
      Life, and hard, bitter necessity have taught me that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. And life has taught me not to
      believe in fine speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Then life has taught you
      something very reasonable. But deeds you must believe in?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. What do you mean by that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. You said you were like a
      shipwrecked man clinging to some wreckage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I had good reason to say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Well, I am like a shipwrecked
      woman clinging to some wreckage--no one to mourn for, no one to care for.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. It was your own choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. There was no other choice--then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Well, what now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Nils, how would it be if we two
      shipwrecked people could join forces?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. What are you saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Two on the same piece of
      wreckage would stand a better chance than each on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Christine I...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. What do you suppose brought me
      to town?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Do you mean that you gave me a
      thought?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I could not endure life without
      work. All my life, as long as I can remember, I have worked, and it has
      been my greatest and only pleasure. But now I am quite alone in the
      world--my life is so dreadfully empty and I feel so forsaken. There is not
      the least pleasure in working for one's self. Nils, give me someone and
      something to work for.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I don't trust that. It is nothing
      but a woman's overstrained sense of generosity that prompts you to make
      such an offer of yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Have you ever noticed anything
      of the sort in me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Could you really do it? Tell
      me--do you know all about my past life?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. And do you know what they think
      of me here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. You seemed to me to imply that
      with me you might have been quite another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I am certain of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Is it too late now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Christine, are you saying this
      deliberately? Yes, I am sure you are. I see it in your face. Have you
      really the courage, then--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I want to be a mother to
      someone, and your children need a mother. We two need each other. Nils, I
      have faith in your real character--I can dare anything together with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad </span><span class="stage-direction">[grasps
      her hands]</span>. Thanks, thanks, Christine! Now I shall find a way to
      clear myself in the eyes of the world. Ah, but I forgot--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[listening]</span>.
      Hush! The Tarantella! Go, go!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Why? What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Do you hear them up there? When
      that is over, we may expect them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Yes, yes--I will go. But it is
      all no use. Of course you are not aware what steps I have taken in the
      matter of the Helmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, I know all about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. And in spite of that have you the
      courage to--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. I understand very well to what
      lengths a man like you might be driven by despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. If I could only undo what I have
      done!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. You cannot. Your letter is lying
      in the letter-box now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Are you sure of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Quite sure, but--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad </span><span class="stage-direction">[with
      a searching look at her]</span>. Is that what it all means?--that you want
      to save your friend at any cost? Tell me frankly. Is that it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Nils, a woman who has once sold
      herself for another's sake, doesn't do it a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I will ask for my letter back.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No, no.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Yes, of course I will. I will
      wait here until Helmer comes; I will tell him he must give me my letter
      back--that it only concerns my dismissal--that he is not to read it--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. No, Nils, you must not recall
      your letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. But, tell me, wasn't it for that
      very purpose that you asked me to meet you here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. In my first moment of fright, it
      was. But twenty-four hours have elapsed since then, and in that time I
      have witnessed incredible things in this house. Helmer must know all about
      it. This unhappy secret must be disclosed; they must have a complete
      understanding between them, which is impossible with all this concealment
      and falsehood going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. Very well, if you will take the
      responsibility. But there is one thing I can do in any case, and I shall
      do it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[listening]</span>.
      You must be quick and go! The dance is over; we are not safe a moment
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I will wait for you below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, do. You must see me back to
      my door...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Krogstad</span>. I have never had such an amazing
      piece of good fortune in my life! <span class="stage-direction">[Goes out

      what a difference! Someone to work for and live for--a home to bring

      come--<span class="stage-direction">[Listens.]</span> Ah, there they are

      please--only an hour more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Not a single minute, my sweet Nora.
      You know that was our agreement. Come along into the room; you are
      catching cold standing there. <span class="stage-direction">[He brings her
      gently into the room, in spite of her resistance.]</span>

    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Good evening.

    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Christine!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You here, so late, Mrs Linde?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, you must excuse me; I was
      so anxious to see Nora in her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Have you been sitting here waiting
      for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, unfortunately I came too
      late, you had already gone upstairs; and I thought I couldn't go away
      again without having seen you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[taking
      off NORA'S shawl]</span>. Yes, take a good look at her. I think she is
      worth looking at. Isn't she charming, Mrs Linde?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, indeed she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Doesn't she look remarkably pretty?
      Everyone thought so at the dance. But she is terribly self-willed, this
      sweet little person. What are we to do with her? You will hardly believe
      that I had almost to bring her away by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Torvald, you will repent not having
      let me stay, even if it were only for half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Listen to her, Mrs Linde! She had
      danced her Tarantella, and it had been a tremendous success, as it
      deserved--although possibly the performance was a trifle too realistic--a
      little more so, I mean, than was strictly compatible with the limitations
      of art. But never mind about that! The chief thing is, she had made a
      success--she had made a tremendous success. Do you think I was going to
      let her remain there after that, and spoil the effect? No, indeed! I took
      my charming little Capri maiden--my capricious little Capri maiden, I
      should say--on my arm; took one quick turn round the room; a curtsey on
      either side, and, as they say in novels, the beautiful apparition
      disappeared. An exit ought always to be effective, Mrs Linde; but that is
      what I cannot make Nora understand. Pooh! this room is hot. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Throws his domino on a chair, and opens the door
      of his room.]</span> Hullo! it's all dark in here. Oh, of course--excuse
      me--. <span class="stage-direction">[He goes in, and lights some candles.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[in a
      hurried and breathless whisper]</span>. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[in
      a low voice]</span>. I have had a talk with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, and--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Nora, you must tell your husband
      all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[in an
      expressionless voice]</span>. I knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. You have nothing to be afraid of
      as far as Krogstad is concerned; but you must tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I won't tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Then the letter will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Thank you, Christine. Now I know what
      I must do. Hush--!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[coming
      in again]</span>. Well, Mrs Linde, have you admired her?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, and now I will say
      goodnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What, already? Is this yours, this
      knitting?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span> <span class="stage-direction">[taking
      it]</span>. Yes, thank you, I had very nearly forgotten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. So you knit?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Do you know, you ought to
      embroider.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Really? Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Yes, it's far more becoming. Let me
      show you. You hold the embroidery thus in your left hand, and use the
      needle with the right--like this--with a long, easy sweep. Do you see?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Yes, perhaps--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But in the case of knitting--that
      can never be anything but ungraceful; look here--the arms close together,
      the knitting-needles going up and down--it has a sort of Chinese effect--.
      That was really excellent champagne they gave us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Well,--goodnight, Nora, and
      don't be self-willed any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. That's right, Mrs Linde.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Mrs Linde</span>. Goodnight, Mr. Helmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[accompanying
      her to the door]</span>. Goodnight, goodnight. I hope you will get home
      all right. I should be very happy to--but you haven't any great distance
      to go. Goodnight, goodnight. <span class="stage-direction">[She goes out;
      he shuts the door after her, and comes in again.]</span> Ah!--at last we
      have got rid of her. She is a frightful bore, that woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Aren't you very tired, Torvald?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. No, not in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Nor sleepy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Not a bit. On the contrary, I feel
      extraordinarily lively. And you?--you really look both tired and sleepy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, I am very tired. I want to go to
      sleep at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. There, you see it was quite right
      of me not to let you stay there any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Everything you do is quite right,
      Torvald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[kissing
      her on the forehead]</span>. Now my little skylark is speaking reasonably.
      Did you notice what good spirits Rank was in this evening?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Really? Was he? I didn't speak to him
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And I very little, but I have not
      for a long time seen him in such good form. <span class="stage-direction">[Looks
      for a while at her and then goes nearer to her.]</span> It is delightful
      to be at home by ourselves again, to be all alone with you--you
      fascinating, charming little darling!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Don't look at me like that, Torvald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Why shouldn't I look at my dearest
      treasure?--at all the beauty that is mine, all my very own?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[going
      to the other side of the table]</span>. You mustn't say things like that
      to me tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[following
      her]</span>. You have still got the Tarantella in your blood, I see. And
      it makes you more captivating than ever. Listen--the guests are beginning
      to go now. <span class="stage-direction">[In a lower voice.]</span>
      Nora--soon the whole house will be quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, I hope so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Yes, my own darling Nora. Do you
      know, when I am out at a party with you like this, why I speak so little
      to you, keep away from you, and only send a stolen glance in your
      direction now and then?--do you know why I do that? It is because I make
      believe to myself that we are secretly in love, and you are my secretly
      promised bride, and that no one suspects there is anything between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, yes--I know very well your
      thoughts are with me all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And when we are leaving, and I am
      putting the shawl over your beautiful young shoulders--on your lovely
      neck--then I imagine that you are my young bride and that we have just
      come from the wedding, and I am bringing you for the first time into our
      home--to be alone with you for the first time--quite alone with my shy
      little darling! All this evening I have longed for nothing but you. When I
      watched the seductive figures of the Tarantella, my blood was on fire; I
      could endure it no longer, and that was why I brought you down so early--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Go away, Torvald! You must let me go.
      I won't--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What's that? You're joking, my
      little Nora! You won't--you won't? Am I not your husband--? <span
      class="stage-direction">[A knock is heard at the outer door.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[starting]</span>.
      Did you hear--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[going
      into the hall]</span>. Who is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[outside]</span>.
      It is I. May I come in for a moment?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[in a
      fretful whisper]</span>. Oh, what does he want now? <span
      class="stage-direction">[Aloud.]</span> Wait a minute! <span
      class="stage-direction">[Unlocks the door.]</span> Come, that's kind of
      you not to pass by our door.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. I thought I heard your voice, and
      felt as if I should like to look in. <span class="stage-direction">[With a
      swift glance round.]</span> Ah, yes!--these dear familiar rooms. You are
      very happy and cosy in here, you two.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. It seems to me that you looked
      after yourself pretty well upstairs too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Excellently. Why shouldn't I? Why
      shouldn't one enjoy everything in this world?--at any rate as much as one
      can, and as long as one can. The wine was capital--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Especially the champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. So you noticed that too? It is almost
      incredible how much I managed to put away!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Torvald drank a great deal of
      champagne tonight too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Did he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, and he is always in such good
      spirits afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Well, why should one not enjoy a
      merry evening after a well-spent day?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Well spent? I am afraid I can't
      take credit for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[clapping
      him on the back]</span>. But I can, you know!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Doctor Rank, you must have been
      occupied with some scientific investigation today.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Just listen!--little Nora talking
      about scientific investigations!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And may I congratulate you on the
      result?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Indeed you may.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Was it favourable, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. The best possible, for both doctor
      and patient--certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[quickly
      and searchingly]</span>. Certainty?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Absolute certainty. So wasn't I
      entitled to make a merry evening of it after that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, you certainly were, Doctor Rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. I think so too, so long as you
      don't have to pay for it in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Oh well, one can't have anything in
      this life without paying for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Doctor Rank--are you fond of
      fancy-dress balls?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Yes, if there is a fine lot of pretty
      costumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Tell me--what shall we two wear at
      the next?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Little featherbrain!--are you
      thinking of the next already?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. We two? Yes, I can tell you. You
      shall go as a good fairy--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Yes, but what do you suggest as an
      appropriate costume for that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Let your wife go dressed just as she
      is in everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. That was really very prettily
      turned. But can't you tell us what you will be?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Yes, my dear friend, I have quite
      made up my mind about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. At the next fancy-dress ball I shall
      be invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. That's a good joke!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. There is a big black hat--have you
      never heard of hats that make you invisible? If you put one on, no one can
      see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[suppressing
      a smile]</span>. Yes, you are quite right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. But I am clean forgetting what I came
      for. Helmer, give me a cigar--one of the dark Havanas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. With the greatest pleasure. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Offers him his case.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank </span><span class="stage-direction">[takes a
      cigar and cuts off the end]</span>. Thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[striking
      a match]</span>. Let me give you a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Thank you. <span
      class="stage-direction">[She holds the match for him to light his cigar.]</span>
      And now goodbye!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Goodbye, goodbye, dear old man!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Sleep well, Doctor Rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. Thank you for that wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Wish me the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Rank</span>. You? Well, if you want me to sleep
      well! And thanks for the light. <span class="stage-direction">[He nods to
      them both and goes out.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[in a
      subdued voice]</span>. He has drunk more than he ought.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[absently]</span>.
      Maybe. <span class="stage-direction">[HELMER takes a bunch of keys out of
      his pocket and goes into the hall.]</span> Torvald! what are you going to
      do there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Emptying the letter-box; it is
      quite full; there will be no room to put the newspaper in tomorrow
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Are you going to work tonight?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You know quite well I'm not. What
      is this? Someone has been at the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. At the lock--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Yes, someone has. What can it mean?
      I should never have thought the maid--. Here is a broken hairpin. Nora, it
      is one of yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[quickly]</span>.
      Then it must have been the children--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Then you must get them out of those
      ways. There, at last I have got it open. <span class="stage-direction">[Takes
      out the contents of the letter-box, and calls to the kitchen.]</span>
      Helen!--Helen, put out the light over the front door. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Goes back into the room and shuts the door into
      the hall. He holds out his hand full of letters.]</span> Look at
      that--look what a heap of them there are. <span class="stage-direction">[Turning
      them over.]</span> What on earth is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[at the
      window]</span>. The letter--No! Torvald, no!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Two cards--of Rank's.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Of Doctor Rank's?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[looking
      at them]</span>. Doctor Rank. They were on the top. He must have put them
      in when he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Is there anything written on them?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. There is a black cross over the
      name. Look there--what an uncomfortable idea! It looks as if he were
      announcing his own death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It is just what he is doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What? Do you know anything about
      it? Has he said anything to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes. He told me that when the cards
      came it would be his leave-taking from us. He means to shut himself up and
      die.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. My poor old friend! Certainly I
      knew we should not have him very long with us. But so soon! And so he
      hides himself away like a wounded animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. If it has to happen, it is best it
      should be without a word--don't you think so, Torvald?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[walking
      up and down]</span>. He had so grown into our lives. I can't think of him
      as having gone out of them. He, with his sufferings and his loneliness,
      was like a cloudy background to our sunlit happiness. Well, perhaps it is
      best so. For him, anyway. <span class="stage-direction">[Standing still.]</span>
      And perhaps for us too, Nora. We two are thrown quite upon each other now.
      <span class="stage-direction">[Puts his arms round her.]</span> My darling
      wife, I don't feel as if I could hold you tight enough. Do you know, Nora,
      I have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so
      that I might risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[disengages
      herself, and says firmly and decidedly]</span>. Now you must read your
      letters, Torvald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. No, no; not tonight. I want to be
      with you, my darling wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. With the thought of your friend's
      death--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You are right, it has affected us
      both. Something ugly has come between us--the thought of the horrors of
      death. We must try and rid our minds of that. Until then--we will each go
      to our own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[hanging
      on his neck]</span>. Goodnight, Torvald--Goodnight!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[kissing
      her on the forehead]</span>. Goodnight, my little singing-bird. Sleep
      sound, Nora. Now I will read my letters through. <span
      class="stage-direction">[He takes his letters and goes into his room,
      shutting the door after him.]</span>

      Never! Never! <span class="stage-direction">[Puts her shawl over her head.]</span>
      Never to see my children again either--never again. Never! Never!--Ah! the
      icy, black water--the unfathomable depths--If only it were over! He has
      got it now--now he is reading it. Goodbye, Torvald and my children! <span
      class="stage-direction">[She is about to rush out through the hall, when
      HELMER opens his door hurriedly and stands with an open letter in his
      hand.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Ah!--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What is this? Do you know what is
      in this letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, I know. Let me go! Let me get
      out!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[holding
      her back]</span>. Where are you going?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[trying
      to get free]</span>. You shan't save me, Torvald!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[reeling]</span>.
      True? Is this true, that I read here? Horrible! No, no--it is impossible
      that it can be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It is true. I have loved you above
      everything else in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Oh, don't let us have any silly
      excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[taking
      a step towards him]</span>. Torvald--!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Miserable creature--what have you
      done?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Let me go. You shall not suffer for
      my sake. You shall not take it upon yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. No tragic airs, please. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Locks the hall door.]</span> Here you shall stay
      and give me an explanation. Do you understand what you have done? Answer
      me! Do you understand what you have done?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[looks
      steadily at him and says with a growing look of coldness in her face]</span>.
      Yes, now I am beginning to understand thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[walking
      about the room]</span>. What a horrible awakening! All these eight
      years--she who was my joy and pride--a hypocrite, a liar--worse, worse--a
      criminal! The unutterable ugliness of it all!--For shame! For shame! <span
      class="stage-direction">[NORA is silent and looks steadily at him. He
      stops in front of her.]</span> I ought to have suspected that something of
      the sort would happen. I ought to have foreseen it. All your father's want
      of principle--be silent!--all your father's want of principle has come out
      in you. No religion, no morality, no sense of duty--. How I am punished
      for having winked at what he did! I did it for your sake, and this is how
      you repay me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, that's just it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Now you have destroyed all my
      happiness. You have ruined all my future. It is horrible to think of! I am
      in the power of an unscrupulous man; he can do what he likes with me, ask
      anything he likes of me, give me any orders he pleases--I dare not refuse.
      And I must sink to such miserable depths because of a thoughtless woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. When I am out of the way, you will be
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. No fine speeches, please. Your
      father had always plenty of those ready, too. What good would it be to me
      if you were out of the way, as you say? Not the slightest. He can make the
      affair known everywhere; and if he does, I may be falsely suspected of
      having been a party to your criminal action. Very likely people will think
      I was behind it all--that it was I who prompted you! And I have to thank
      you for all this--you whom I have cherished during the whole of our
      married life. Do you understand now what it is you have done for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[coldly
      and quietly]</span>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. It is so incredible that I can't
      take it in. But we must come to some understanding. Take off that shawl.
      Take it off, I tell you. I must try and appease him some way or another.
      The matter must be hushed up at any cost. And as for you and me, it must
      appear as if everything between us were just as before--but naturally only
      in the eyes of the world. You will still remain in my house, that is a
      matter of course. But I shall not allow you to bring up the children; I
      dare not trust them to you. To think that I should be obliged to say so to
      one whom I have loved so dearly, and whom I still--. No, that is all over.
      From this moment happiness is not the question; all that concerns us is to
      save the remains, the fragments, the appearance--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="stage-direction">[A ring is heard at the front-door bell.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[with
      a start]</span>. What is that? So late! Can the worst--? Can he--? Hide
      yourself, Nora. Say you are ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="stage-direction">[NORA stands motionless. HELMER goes and
      unlocks the hall door.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Maid </span><span class="stage-direction">[half-dressed,
      comes to the door]</span>. A letter for the mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Give it to me. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Takes the letter, and shuts the door.]</span>
      Yes, it is from him. You shall not have it; I will read it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[standing
      by the lamp]</span>. I scarcely have the courage to do it. It may mean
      ruin for both of us. No, I must know. <span class="stage-direction">[Tears
      open the letter, runs his eye over a few lines, looks at a paper enclosed,

      looks at him questioningly.]</span> Nora!--No, I must read it once
      again--. Yes, it is true! I am saved! Nora, I am saved!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And I?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You too, of course; we are both
      saved, both you and I. Look, he sends you your bond back. He says he
      regrets and repents--that a happy change in his life--never mind what he
      says! We are saved, Nora! No one can do anything to you. Oh, Nora,
      Nora!--no, first I must destroy these hateful things. Let me see--. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Takes a look at the bond.]</span> No, no, I won't
      look at it. The whole thing shall be nothing but a bad dream to me. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Tears up the bond and both letters, throws them
      all into the stove, and watches them burn.]</span> There--now it doesn't
      exist any longer. He says that since Christmas Eve you--. These must have
      been three dreadful days for you, Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I have fought a hard fight these
      three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And suffered agonies, and seen no
      way out but--. No, we won't call any of the horrors to mind. We will only
      shout with joy, and keep saying, "It's all over! It's all over!" Listen to
      me, Nora. You don't seem to realise that it is all over. What is
      this?--such a cold, set face! My poor little Nora, I quite understand; you
      don't feel as if you could believe that I have forgiven you. But it is
      true, Nora, I swear it; I have forgiven you everything. I know that what
      you did, you did out of love for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. That is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You have loved me as a wife ought
      to love her husband. Only you had not sufficient knowledge to judge of the
      means you used. But do you suppose you are any the less dear to me,
      because you don't understand how to act on your own responsibility? No,
      no; only lean on me; I will advise you and direct you. I should not be a
      man if this womanly helplessness did not just give you a double
      attractiveness in my eyes. You must not think anymore about the hard
      things I said in my first moment of consternation, when I thought
      everything was going to overwhelm me. I have forgiven you, Nora; I swear
      to you I have forgiven you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Thank you for your forgiveness. <span
      class="stage-direction">[She goes out through the door to the right.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. No, don't go--. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Looks in.]</span> What are you doing in there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[from
      within]</span>. Taking off my fancy dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[standing
      at the open door]</span>. Yes, do. Try and calm yourself, and make your
      mind easy again, my frightened little singing-bird. Be at rest, and feel
      secure; I have broad wings to shelter you under. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Walks up and down by the door.]</span> How warm
      and cosy our home is, Nora. Here is shelter for you; here I will protect
      you like a hunted dove that I have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring
      peace to your poor beating heart. It will come, little by little, Nora,
      believe me. Tomorrow morning you will look upon it all quite differently;
      soon everything will be just as it was before. Very soon you won't need me
      to assure you that I have forgiven you; you will yourself feel the
      certainty that I have done so. Can you suppose I should ever think of such
      a thing as repudiating you, or even reproaching you? You have no idea what
      a true man's heart is like, Nora. There is something so indescribably
      sweet and satisfying, to a man, in the knowledge that he has forgiven his
      wife--forgiven her freely, and with all his heart. It seems as if that had
      made her, as it were, doubly his own; he has given her a new life, so to
      speak; and she has in a way become both wife and child to him. So you
      shall be for me after this, my little scared, helpless darling. Have no
      anxiety about anything, Nora; only be frank and open with me, and I will
      serve as will and conscience both to you--. What is this? Not gone to bed?
      Have you changed your things?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[in
      everyday dress]</span>. Yes, Torvald, I have changed my things now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But what for?--so late as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I shall not sleep tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But, my dear Nora--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[looking
      at her watch]</span>. It is not so very late. Sit down here, Torvald. You
      and I have much to say to one another. <span class="stage-direction">[She
      sits down at one side of the table.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora--what is this?--this cold, set
      face?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Sit down. It will take some time; I
      have a lot to talk over with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[sits
      down at the opposite side of the table]</span>. You alarm me, Nora!--and I
      don't understand you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, that is just it. You don't
      understand me, and I have never understood you either--before tonight. No,
      you mustn't interrupt me. You must simply listen to what I say. Torvald,
      this is a settling of accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What do you mean by that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[after a
      short silence]</span>. Isn't there one thing that strikes you as strange
      in our sitting here like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. We have been married now eight years.
      Does it not occur to you that this is the first time we two, you and I,
      husband and wife, have had a serious conversation?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What do you mean by serious?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. In all these eight years--longer than
      that--from the very beginning of our acquaintance, we have never exchanged
      a word on any serious subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Was it likely that I would be
      continually and forever telling you about worries that you could not help
      me to bear?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I am not speaking about business
      matters. I say that we have never sat down in earnest together to try and
      get at the bottom of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But, dearest Nora, would it have
      been any good to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. That is just it; you have never
      understood me. I have been greatly wronged, Torvald--first by papa and
      then by you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What! By us two--by us two, who
      have loved you better than anyone else in the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[shaking
      her head]</span>. You have never loved me. You have only thought it
      pleasant to be in love with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora, what do I hear you saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It is perfectly true, Torvald. When I
      was at home with papa, he told me his opinion about everything, and so I
      had the same opinions; and if I differed from him I concealed the fact,
      because he would not have liked it. He called me his doll-child, and he
      played with me just as I used to play with my dolls. And when I came to
      live with you--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What sort of an expression is that
      to use about our marriage?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[undisturbed]</span>.
      I mean that I was simply transferred from papa's hands into yours. You
      arranged everything according to your own taste, and so I got the same
      tastes as your else I pretended to, I am really not quite sure which--I
      think sometimes the one and sometimes the other. When I look back on it,
      it seems to me as if I had been living here like a poor woman--just from
      hand to mouth. I have existed merely to perform tricks for you, Torvald.
      But you would have it so. You and papa have committed a great sin against
      me. It is your fault that I have made nothing of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. How unreasonable and how ungrateful
      you are, Nora! Have you not been happy here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, I have never been happy. I
      thought I was, but it has never really been so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Not--not happy!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, only merry. And you have always
      been so kind to me. But our home has been nothing but a playroom. I have
      been your doll-wife, just as at home I was papa's doll-child; and here the
      children have been my dolls. I thought it great fun when you played with
      me, just as they thought it great fun when I played with them. That is
      what our marriage has been, Torvald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. There is some truth in what you
      say--exaggerated and strained as your view of it is. But for the future it
      shall be different. Playtime shall be over, and lesson-time shall begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Whose lessons? Mine, or the
      children's?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Both yours and the children's, my
      darling Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Alas, Torvald, you are not the man to
      educate me into being a proper wife for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And you can say that!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. And I--how am I fitted to bring up
      the children?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Didn't you say so yourself a little
      while ago--that you dare not trust me to bring them up?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. In a moment of anger! Why do you
      pay any heed to that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Indeed, you were perfectly right. I
      am not fit for the task. There is another task I must undertake first. I
      must try and educate myself--you are not the man to help me in that. I
      must do that for myself. And that is why I am going to leave you now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[springing
      up]</span>. What do you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I must stand quite alone, if I am to
      understand myself and everything about me. It is for that reason that I
      cannot remain with you any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora, Nora!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I am going away from here now, at
      once. I am sure Christine will take me in for the night--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You are out of your mind! I won't
      allow it! I forbid you!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It is no use forbidding me anything
      any longer. I will take with me what belongs to myself. I will take
      nothing from you, either now or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What sort of madness is this!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Tomorrow I shall go home--I mean, to
      my old home. It will be easiest for me to find something to do there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You blind, foolish woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I must try and get some sense,
      Torvald.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. To desert your home, your husband
      and your children! And you don't consider what people will say!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I cannot consider that at all. I only
      know that it is necessary for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. It's shocking. This is how you
      would neglect your most sacred duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What do you consider my most sacred
      duties?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Do I need to tell you that? Are
      they not your duties to your husband and your children?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I have other duties just as sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. That you have not. What duties
      could those be?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Duties to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Before all else, you are a wife and
      a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I don't believe that any longer. I
      believe that before all else I am a reasonable human being, just as you
      are--or, at all events, that I must try and become one. I know quite well,
      Torvald, that most people would think you right, and that views of that
      kind are to be found in books; but I can no longer content myself with
      what most people say, or with what is found in books. I must think over
      things for myself and get to understand them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Can you not understand your place
      in your own home? Have you not a reliable guide in such matters as
      that?--have you no religion?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I am afraid, Torvald, I do not
      exactly know what religion is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. What are you saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I know nothing but what the clergyman
      said, when I went to be confirmed. He told us that religion was this, and
      that, and the other. When I am away from all this, and am alone, I will
      look into that matter too. I will see if what the clergyman said is true,
      or at all events if it is true for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. This is unheard of in a girl of
      your age! But if religion cannot lead you aright, let me try and awaken
      your conscience. I suppose you have some moral sense? Or--answer me--am I
      to think you have none?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I assure you, Torvald, that is not an
      easy question to answer. I really don't know. The thing perplexes me
      altogether. I only know that you and I look at it in quite a different
      light. I am learning, too, that the law is quite another thing from what I
      supposed; but I find it impossible to convince myself that the law is
      right. According to it a woman has no right to spare her old dying father,
      or to save her husband's life. I can't believe that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You talk like a child. You don't
      understand the conditions of the world in which you live.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, I don't. But now I am going to
      try. I am going to see if I can make out who is right, the world or I.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You are ill, Nora; you are
      delirious; I almost think you are out of your mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I have never felt my mind so clear
      and certain as tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And is it with a clear and certain
      mind that you forsake your husband and your children?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Then there is only one possible
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. What is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. You do not love me anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No, that is just it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora!--and you can say that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It gives me great pain, Torvald, for
      you have always been so kind to me, but I cannot help it. I do not love
      you any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[regaining
      his composure]</span>. Is that a clear and certain conviction too?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, absolutely clear and certain.
      That is the reason why I will not stay here any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. And can you tell me what I have
      done to forfeit your love?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Yes, indeed I can. It was tonight,
      when the wonderful thing did not happen; then I saw you were not the man I
      had thought you were.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Explain yourself better. I don't
      understand you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I have waited so patiently for eight
      years; for, goodness knows, I knew very well that wonderful things don't
      happen every day. Then this horrible misfortune came upon me; and then I
      felt quite certain that the wonderful thing was going to happen at last.
      When Krogstad's letter was lying out there, never for a moment did I
      imagine that you would consent to accept this man's conditions. I was so
      absolutely certain that you would say to him: Publish the thing to the
      whole world. And when that was done--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Yes, what then?--when I had exposed
      my wife to shame and disgrace?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. When that was done, I was so
      absolutely certain, you would come forward and take everything upon
      yourself, and say: I am the guilty one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora--!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. You mean that I would never have
      accepted such a sacrifice on your part? No, of course not. But what would
      my assurances have been worth against yours? That was the wonderful thing
      which I hoped for and feared; and it was to prevent that, that I wanted to
      kill myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. I would gladly work night and day
      for you, Nora--bear sorrow and want for your sake. But no man would
      sacrifice his honour for the one he loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. It is a thing hundreds of thousands
      of women have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Oh, you think and talk like a
      heedless child.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Maybe. But you neither think nor talk
      like the man I could bind myself to. As soon as your fear was over--and it
      was not fear for what threatened me, but for what might happen to
      you--when the whole thing was past, as far as you were concerned it was
      exactly as if nothing at all had happened. Exactly as before, I was your
      little skylark, your doll, which you would in future treat with doubly
      gentle care, because it was so brittle and fragile. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Getting up.]</span> Torvald--it was then it
      dawned upon me that for eight years I had been living here with a strange
      man, and had borne him three children--. Oh, I can't bear to think of it!
      I could tear myself into little bits!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[sadly]</span>.
      I see, I see. An abyss has opened between us--there is no denying it. But,
      Nora, would it not be possible to fill it up?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. As I am now, I am no wife for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. I have it in me to become a
      different man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Perhaps--if your doll is taken away
      from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But to part!--to part from you! No,
      no, Nora, I can't understand that idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[going
      out to the right]</span>. That makes it all the more certain that it must
      be done. <span class="stage-direction">[She comes back with her cloak and
      hat and a small bag which she puts on a chair by the table.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora, Nora, not now! Wait until
      tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[putting
      on her cloak]</span>. I cannot spend the night in a strange man's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But can't we live here like brother
      and sister--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[putting
      on her hat]</span>. You know very well that would not last long. <span
      class="stage-direction">[Puts the shawl round her.]</span> Goodbye,
      Torvald. I won't see the little ones. I know they are in better hands than
      mine. As I am now, I can be of no use to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But some day, Nora--some day?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. How can I tell? I have no idea what
      is going to become of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But you are my wife, whatever
      becomes of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Listen, Torvald. I have heard that
      when a wife deserts her husband's house, as I am doing now, he is legally
      freed from all obligations towards her. In any case, I set you free from
      all your obligations. You are not to feel yourself bound in the slightest
      way, any more than I shall. There must be perfect freedom on both sides.
      See, here is your ring back. Give me mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. That too?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. That too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Here it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. That's right. Now it is all over. I
      have put the keys here. The maids know all about everything in the
      house--better than I do. Tomorrow, after I have left her, Christine will
      come here and pack up my own things that I brought with me from home. I
      will have them sent after me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. All over! All over!--Nora, shall
      you never think of me again?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. I know I shall often think of you,
      the children, and this house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. May I write to you, Nora?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No--never. You must not do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But at least let me send you--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Nothing--nothing--
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Let me help you if you are in want.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. No. I can receive nothing from a
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Nora--can I never be anything more
      than a stranger to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora </span><span class="stage-direction">[taking
      her bag]</span>. Ah, Torvald, the most wonderful thing of all would have
      to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. Tell me what that would be!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. Both you and I would have to be so
      changed that--. Oh, Torvald, I don't believe any longer in wonderful
      things happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer</span>. But I will believe in it. Tell me!
      So changed that--?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Nora</span>. That our life together would be a
      real wedlock. Goodbye. <span class="stage-direction">[She goes out through
      the hall.]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="character">Helmer </span><span class="stage-direction">[sinks
      down on a chair at the door and buries his face in his hands]</span>.
      Nora! Nora! <span class="stage-direction">[Looks round, and rises.]</span>
      Empty. She is gone. <span class="stage-direction">[A hope flashes across
      his mind.]</span> The most wonderful thing of all--?

1.F.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
